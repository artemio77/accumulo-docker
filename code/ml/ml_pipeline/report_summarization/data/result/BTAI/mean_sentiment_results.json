        "880": "and some foreign jurisdictions , there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably . for example , in the u . s . , the aca has substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government health plans and private insurers , and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry .",
        "881": "for example , the aca imposed a non - deductible excise tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers that sell branded prescription drugs to government programs .",
