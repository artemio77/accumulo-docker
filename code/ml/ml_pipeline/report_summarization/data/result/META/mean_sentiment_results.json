        "21": "we believe our family metrics better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our products .",
        "22": "as a result , over time we intend to report our family metrics as key metrics in place of daus , maus , and arpu in our periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission . while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement , there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world .",
        "23": "the methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors .",
        "24": "in addition , we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base , and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology .",
        "25": "we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics , and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy , which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics .",
        "26": "our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments .",
        "27": "we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below . in addition , our family metrics and facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology . family metricsmany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products , and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product .",
        "28": "accordingly , for our family metrics , we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community .",
        "29": "rather , our family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook , instagram , messenger , and whatsapp .",
        "30": "we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family , and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people .",
        "31": "to calculate these metrics , we rely upon complex techniques , algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts , including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person , and counting such group of accounts as one person .",
        "32": "these techniques and models require significant judgment , are subject to data and other limitations discussed below , and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties .",
        "33": "we estimate the potential error in our family metrics primarily based on user survey data , which itself is subject to error as well .",
        "34": "while we expect the error margin for our family metrics to vary from period to period , we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3 % of our worldwide map .",
        "35": "at our scale , it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people , and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates , potentially beyond our estimated error margins .",
        "36": "as a result , it is also possible that our family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends . to calculate our estimates of family dap and map , we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data .",
        "37": "we apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates .",
        "38": "for example , to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products , we use data signals such as similar device information , ip addresses , and user names .",
        "39": "we also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products , which are inherently subject to error .",
        "40": "the timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed , and may in the future contribute , to changes in our reported family metrics from period to period .",
        "41": "in addition , our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metrics estimates .",
        "42": "our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products , and we rely on more limited data signals 4table of contentsfor some products compared to others .",
        "43": "for example , as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products , we have fewer data signals from whatsapp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match whatsapp user accounts with accounts on our other products .",
        "44": "similarly , although messenger kids users are included in our family metrics , we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating dap and map .",
        "45": "any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating family metrics , whether as a result of our own product decisions , actions by third - party browser or mobile platforms , regulatory or legislative requirements , or other factors , also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metrics , as well as our ability to report these metrics at all .",
        "46": "our estimates of family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve , including through the application of new data signals or technologies , product changes , or other improvements in our user surveys , algorithms , or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users .",
        "47": "in addition , such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts ( as defined below ) . we regularly evaluate our family metrics to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of \" violating \" accounts .",
        "48": "we define \" violating \" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service , including bots and spam .",
        "49": "in the fourth quarter of 2022 , we estimated that approximately 3 % of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating accounts .",
        "50": "such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts , and we apply significant judgment in making this determination .",
        "51": "for example , we look for account information and behaviors associated with facebook and instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers , but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption .",
        "52": "in addition , if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts , we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account .",
        "53": "from time to time , we disable certain user accounts , make product changes , or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users , which may also reduce our dap and map estimates in a particular period .",
        "54": "we intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis .",
        "55": "violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale , and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates . the numbers of family dap and map discussed in this quarterly report on form 10 - q , as well as arpp , do not include users on our other products , unless they would otherwise qualify as dap or map , respectively , based on their other activities on our family products . facebook metricswe regularly evaluate our facebook metrics to estimate the number of \" duplicate \" and \" false \" accounts among our maus .",
        "56": "a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account .",
        "57": "we divide \" false \" accounts into two categories : ( 1 ) & # 160 ; user - misclassified accounts , where users have created personal profiles for a business , organization , or non - human entity such as a pet ( such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service ) ; and ( 2 ) & # 160 ; violating accounts , which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service , such as bots and spam .",
        "58": "the estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts , and we apply significant judgment in making this determination .",
        "59": "for example , to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical ip addresses and similar user names , and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers .",
        "60": "any loss of access to data signals we use in this process , whether as a result of our own product decisions , actions by third - party browser or mobile platforms , regulatory or legislative requirements , or other factors , also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts .",
        "61": "our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve , including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users .",
        "62": "duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale , and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates . in the fourth quarter of 2022 , we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11 % of our worldwide maus .",
        "63": "we believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the philippines and vietnam , as compared to more developed markets .",
        "64": "in the fourth quarter of 2022 , we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 4 - 5 % of our worldwide maus .",
        "65": "our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts , which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as indonesia , nigeria , and vietnam .",
        "66": "from time to time , we disable certain user accounts , make product changes , or take 5table of contentsother actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users , which may also reduce our dau and mau estimates in a particular period .",

        "620": "if we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future , our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected , which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue . our user growth , engagement , and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems , networks , technologies , products , and standards that we do not control . the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices .",
        "621": "there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature our products , or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products .",
        "622": "we are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems , networks , technologies , products , and standards that we do not control , such as the android and ios operating systems and mobile browsers .",

        "624": "for example , apple previously released an update to its safari browser that limits the use of third - party cookies , which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization , and also released changes to ios that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively , while expanding their own advertising business .",
        "625": "we expect that any similar changes to its , google ' s , or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization .",
        "626": "additionally , in order to deliver high quality mobile products , it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies , products , systems , networks , and standards that we do not control , and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers , mobile carriers , and browser developers .",

        "633": "we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products , including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience .",
        "634": "for example , we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology , which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies .",
        "635": "we continue to incur substantial costs , and we may not be successful in generating profits , in connection with these efforts .",
        "636": "we are also making significant investments in artificial intelligence initiatives across our family of apps .",

        "638": "we have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion , and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term .",
        "639": "we are also moving forward with plans to implement end - to - end encryption across our messaging services , as well as facilitate cross - app communication between these platforms , which are subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions .",
        "640": "if our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users , marketers , or developers , or if our business plans are unsuccessful , we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue , operating margin , or other value to justify our investments , and our business may be adversely affected . we may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives , which could adversely affect our business , reputation , or financial results . we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence ( ai ) initiatives , including to recommend relevant unconnected content across our products , enhance our advertising tools , and develop new product features using generative ai .",
        "641": "in particular , we expect our ai initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount .",
        "642": "ai technologies are complex and rapidly evolving , and we face significant competition from other companies as well as an evolving regulatory landscape .",
        "643": "these efforts , including the introduction of new products or changes to existing products , may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny , litigation , ethical concerns , or other complications that could adversely affect our business , reputation , or financial results .",
        "644": "for example , the use of datasets to develop ai models , the content generated by ai systems , or the application of ai systems may be found to be insufficient , offensive , biased , or harmful , or violate current or future laws and regulations .",
        "645": "in addition , market acceptance of ai technologies is uncertain , and we may be unsuccessful in our product development efforts .",
        "646": "any of these factors could adversely affect our business , reputation , or financial results . we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short - term financial results and may not produce the long - term benefits that we expect . we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short - term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term .",
        "647": "for example , we have implemented , and we will continue to implement , changes to our user data practices .",
        "648": "some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads , which has to some extent adversely affected , and will continue to adversely affect , our advertising business .",
        "649": "for example , our off - facebook activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers ' apps and websites , which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users .",
        "650": "similarly , from time to time we update our feed display and ranking algorithms or other product features to optimize the user experience , and these changes have had , and may in the future have , the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products , which could adversely affect our financial results .",
        "651": "from time to time , we also change the size , frequency , or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies .",
        "652": "in addition , we have made , and we expect to continue to make , other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers , marketers , and developers , and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products .",
        "653": "we also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products , or introduce new stand - alone products , that attract users away from properties , formats , or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization , such as our feed products .",
        "654": "in addition , as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products , from time to time these efforts have reduced , and may in the future reduce , engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully 64table of contentsor that are not growing as quickly .",
        "655": "for example , we plan to continue to promote reels , which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our feed and stories products for the foreseeable future .",
        "656": "these decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long - term benefits that we expect . we may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments , which could adversely affect our business , reputation , or financial results . we believe the metaverse , an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two - dimensional screens , is the next evolution in social technology .",
        "657": "in 2021 , we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life .",
        "658": "we expect this will be a complex , evolving , and long - term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies , continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy , safety , and security efforts , and collaboration with other companies , developers , partners , and other participants .",
        "659": "however , the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations , and market acceptance of features , products , or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain .",
        "660": "we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve .",
        "661": "in addition , we have limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology , which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us .",
        "662": "we may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts , including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies , products , systems , networks , or standards .",
        "663": "our metaverse efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business .",
        "664": "we expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these efforts , and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business .",
        "665": "in addition , as our metaverse efforts evolve , we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the united states and international jurisdictions , including in the areas of privacy , safety , competition , content regulation , consumer protection , and e - commerce , which may delay or impede the development of our products and services , increase our operating costs , require significant management time and attention , or otherwise harm our business .",
        "666": "as a result of these or other factors , our metaverse strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future , or at all , which could adversely affect our business , reputation , or financial results . if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands , our ability to expand our base of users , marketers , and developers may be impaired , and our business and financial results may be harmed . we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business .",
        "667": "we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users , marketers , and developers .",
        "668": "many of our new users are referred by existing users .",
        "669": "maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful , reliable , trustworthy , and innovative products , which we may not do successfully .",
        "670": "we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like , which may negatively affect our brands .",
        "671": "additionally , the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third - party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products .",
        "672": "we will also continue to experience media , legislative , or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy , data use , encryption , content , product design , algorithms , advertising , competition , and other issues , including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events , which has in the past adversely affected , and may in the future adversely affect , our reputation and brands .",
        "673": "for example , beginning in september 2021 , we became the subject of media , legislative , and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee ' s allegations and release of internal company documents relating to , among other things , our algorithms , advertising and user metrics , and content enforcement practices , as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform , and user well - being .",
        "674": "in addition , in march 2018 , we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies .",
        "675": "we also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers , or to otherwise enforce our policies or address user concerns , which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands .",
        "676": "our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users , by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities , by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading ( or intended to manipulate opinions ) , by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security - related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform , by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends , including , for example , any such actions around geopolitical events or elections in the united states and around the world , by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent oversight board , by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user 65table of contentswell - being , or by our decisions regarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service .",
        "677": "maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful .",
        "678": "certain of our actions , such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising , hate speech , and other content , as well as user well - being issues , have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future .",
        "679": "if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort , our business and financial results may be adversely affected . we may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products . we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build , grow , and monetize applications that integrate with our products .",
        "680": "such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building , growing , or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement .",
        "681": "additionally , developers may choose to build on other platforms , including platforms controlled by third parties , rather than building products that integrate with our products .",
        "682": "we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience , and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers .",
        "683": "for example , from time to time , we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the user experience , and such actions have reduced distribution from , user engagement with , and our monetization opportunities from , applications integrated with our products .",
        "684": "in addition , as part of our efforts related to privacy , safety , and security , we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time , and we also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data .",
        "685": "in some instances , these actions , as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers , have adversely affected , or will adversely affect , our relationships with developers .",
        "686": "if we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers , our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected . risks related to our business operations and financial resultsour business is highly competitive .",
        "687": "competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business . we compete with companies providing connection , sharing , discovery , and communication products and services to users online , as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and / or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns .",
        "688": "we face significant competition in every aspect of our business , including , but not limited to , companies that facilitate the ability of users to create , share , communicate , and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences .",
        "689": "we compete to attract , engage , and retain people who use our products , to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services , and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products .",
        "690": "we also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services .",
        "691": "we also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products , as our existing products evolve , or as other companies introduce new products and services , including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate through the application of new technologies such as artificial intelligence . some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources , experience , or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments , geographic regions , or user demographics than we do .",
        "692": "for example , some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political , legal , and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us .",
        "693": "these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions .",
        "694": "we believe that some users , particularly younger users , are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to , or as a substitute for , our products and services , and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services .",
        "695": "in the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services , we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly , in which case our business would likely be harmed . our competitors may develop products , features , or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance , may undertake more far - reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns , or may adopt more 66table of contentsaggressive pricing policies .",
        "696": "some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate , including : by making acquisitions ; by limiting our ability to deliver , target , or measure the effectiveness of ads ; by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads ; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible ; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users ; or by integrating competing platforms , applications , or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems , search engines , browsers , or e - commerce platforms .",
        "697": "for example , each of apple and google have integrated competitive products with ios and android , respectively .",

        "764": "while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement , there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world .",

        "767": "we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics , and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy , which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics .",
        "768": "our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments .",
        "769": "we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below . in addition , our family metrics and facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology . many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products , and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product .",
        "770": "accordingly , for our family metrics , we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community .",
        "771": "rather , our family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook , instagram , messenger , and whatsapp .",
        "772": "we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family , and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people .",
        "773": "to calculate these metrics , we rely upon complex techniques , algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the 72table of contentsindividual people behind user accounts , including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person , and counting such group of accounts as one person .",
        "774": "these techniques and models require significant judgment , are subject to data and other limitations discussed below , and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties .",
        "775": "we estimate the potential error in our family metrics primarily based on user survey data , which itself is subject to error as well .",
        "776": "while we expect the error margin for our family metrics to vary from period to period , we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3 % of our worldwide map .",
        "777": "at our scale , it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people , and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates , potentially beyond our estimated error margins .",
        "778": "as a result , it is also possible that our family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends . to calculate our estimates of family dap and map , we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data .",
        "779": "we apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates .",
        "780": "for example , to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products , we use data signals such as similar device information , ip addresses , and user names .",
        "781": "we also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products , which are inherently subject to error .",
        "782": "the timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed , and may in the future contribute , to changes in our reported family metrics from period to period .",
        "783": "in addition , our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metrics estimates .",
        "784": "our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products , and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others .",
        "785": "for example , as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products , we have fewer data signals from whatsapp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match whatsapp user accounts with accounts on our other products .",
        "786": "similarly , although messenger kids users are included in our family metrics , we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating dap and map .",
        "787": "any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating family metrics , whether as a result of our own product decisions , actions by third - party browser or mobile platforms , regulatory or legislative requirements , or other factors , also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metrics , as well as our ability to report these metrics at all .",
        "788": "our estimates of family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve , including through the application of new data signals or technologies , product changes , or other improvements in our user surveys , algorithms , or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users .",
        "789": "in addition , such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts ( as defined below ) . we regularly evaluate our family metrics to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of \" violating \" accounts .",
        "790": "we define \" violating \" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service , including bots and spam .",
        "791": "in the fourth quarter of 2022 , we estimated that approximately 3 % of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating accounts .",
        "792": "such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts , and we apply significant judgment in making this determination .",
        "793": "for example , we look for account information and behaviors associated with facebook and instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers , but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption .",
        "794": "in addition , if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts , we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account .",
        "795": "from time to time , we disable certain user accounts , make product changes , or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users , which may also reduce our dap and map estimates in a particular period .",
        "796": "we intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis .",
        "797": "violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale , and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates . we also regularly evaluate our facebook metrics to estimate the number of \" duplicate \" and \" false \" accounts among our maus .",
        "798": "a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account .",
        "799": "we divide \" false \" accounts into two categories : ( 1 ) & # 160 ; user - misclassified accounts , where users have created personal profiles for a business , organization , or non - human entity such as a pet ( such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service ) ; and ( 2 ) & # 160 ; violating accounts , which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service , such as bots and spam .",

        "804": "duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale , and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates . in the fourth quarter of 2022 , we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11 % of our worldwide maus .",
        "805": "we believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the philippines and vietnam , as compared to more developed markets .",
        "806": "in the fourth quarter of 2022 , we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 4 - 5 % of our worldwide maus .",

        "870": "in 2021 , more than 140 & # 160 ; countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15 % , among other provisions .",
        "871": "as this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country , the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain .",
        "872": "similarly , the european commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed .",
        "873": "these proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax , as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non - income taxes , including taxes based on a percentage of revenue .",
        "874": "for example , several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services , which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces , and which apply to our business . the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states , including ireland , have provided illegal state aid in certain cases .",
        "875": "these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations .",
        "876": "due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities , many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate , increase the amount of non - income taxes imposed on our business , and harm our financial position , results of operations , and cash flows .",
        "877": "such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements . given our levels of share - based compensation , our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price . the tax effects of the accounting for share - based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period .",
        "878": "in periods in which our stock price varies from the grant price of the share - based compensation vesting in that period , we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate .",
        "879": "for example , in the three months ended march & # 160 ; 31 , 2023 , tax shortfalls recognized from share - based compensation increased our provision for income taxes by $ 88 & # 160 ; million and our effective tax rate by one percentage point as compared to the tax rate without such shortfalls .",

        "881": "the amount and value of share - based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share - based compensation on our effective tax rate .",
        "882": "these tax effects are dependent on our stock price , which we do not control , and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results . if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired , we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings . we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable , such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization .",
        "883": "we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually .",
        "884": "if such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired , an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized .",
        "885": "we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined , which would negatively affect our results of operations . the loss of one or more of our key personnel , or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future , could harm our business . we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel , including mark zuckerberg .",

        "890": "as we continue to mature , the incentives to attract , retain , and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past , and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees , we would incur substantial additional share - based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted .",
        "891": "our ability to attract , retain , and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility .",

        "893": "if we do not succeed in attracting , hiring , and integrating excellent personnel , or retaining and motivating existing personnel , we may be unable to grow effectively . our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock . mark zuckerberg , our founder , chairman , and ceo , is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval , including the election of directors and any merger , consolidation , or sale of all or substantially all of our assets .",

        "895": "this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class & # 160 ; a common stock , which has limited voting power relative to the class & # 160 ; b common stock , and might harm the trading price of our class & # 160 ; a common stock .",

        "917": "federal , state , and foreign laws and regulations , which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities , are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change .",
        "918": "as a result , the application , interpretation , and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain , particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate , and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices .",
        "919": "for example , regulatory or legislative actions or litigation affecting the manner in which we display content to our users , moderate content , provide our services to younger users , or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement .",
        "920": "such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results . we are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether , how , and under what circumstances we can transfer , process and / or receive certain data that is critical to our operations , including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services .",
        "921": "for example , in 2016 , the european union and united states agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united states , called the privacy shield , but the privacy shield was invalidated in july 2020 by the court of justice of the european union ( cjeu ) .",
        "922": "in addition , the other bases upon which meta relies to transfer such data , such as standard contractual clauses ( sccs ) , have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny .",
        "923": "for example , the cjeu considered the validity of sccs as a basis to transfer user data from the european union to the united states following a challenge brought by the irish data protection commission ( idpc ) .",
        "924": "although the cjeu upheld the validity of sccs in july 2020 , our continued reliance on sccs is the subject of regulatory consideration .",
        "925": "in particular , in august 2020 , we received a preliminary draft decision from the idpc that preliminarily concluded that meta platforms ireland ' s reliance on sccs in respect of european economic area 80table of contents ( eea ) facebook user data does not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfers should therefore be suspended .",
        "926": "in february 2022 , we received a revised preliminary draft decision in which the idpc maintained its preliminary conclusion that these transfers should be suspended .",
        "927": "the idpc ' s draft decision was then further refined and shared on july 6 , 2022 with other european data protection regulators ( csas ) as part of the gdpr ' s cooperation mechanism .",
        "928": "on january 19 , 2023 , the idpc referred the inquiry to a vote by the european data protection board ( edpb ) , pursuant to the dispute resolution process under article 65 gdpr known as the consistency mechanism , in respect of elements of the draft decision over which consensus could not be reached between concerned supervisory authorities .",
        "929": "on april 13 , 2023 , the edpb issued a decision and we expect the idpc to issue a final decision in this inquiry in may 2023 .",
        "930": "in addition to the transfer suspension order proposed in the idpc & # 8217 ; s draft decision , it is expected that the idpc will make an order requiring meta platforms ireland to bring its relevant processing operations into compliance with the gdpr and imposing a fine .",
        "931": "we continue to examine the decision and its potential impact on our operations .",
        "932": "we expect that the deadlines to comply with the idpc decision will be no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2023 .",
        "933": "once the final decision is issued , we will have an opportunity to appeal and seek a stay .",
        "934": "a transfer suspension order would become effective after a period of time unless a new transatlantic data transfer framework is finalized prior to that time or the idpc revisits the suspension order due to a material change in u . s .",
        "935": "law . on march & # 160 ; 25 , 2022 , the european union and united states announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new eu - u . s .",
        "936": "on october 7 , 2022 , president biden signed the executive order on enhancing safeguards for united states signals intelligence activities ( e . o .",
        "937": ") , and on december 13 , 2022 , the european commission published its draft adequacy decision on the proposed new eu - u . s .",

        "939": "enabling the european commission to issue its final adequacy decision in respect of this framework , and we continue to evaluate whether and to what extent the idpc decision will impact our data processing operations even after a new data privacy framework is in force .",
        "940": "is a significant and positive step , if no adequacy decision is adopted by the european commission and / or we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or rely upon other alternative legal bases as a means of conducting data transfers from the european union to the united states , we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services , including facebook and instagram , in europe , which would materially and adversely affect our business , financial condition , and results of operations .",
        "941": "the transfer suspension order referenced above would apply to facebook eea user data , but the idpc could bring future proceedings related to eea user data associated with our other products and services unless a new transatlantic data transfer framework is finalized . in addition , we have been managing investigations and lawsuits in europe , india , and other jurisdictions regarding the 2016 and 2021 updates to whatsapp ' s terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other meta products and services , including a lawsuit currently pending before the supreme court of india .",
        "942": "if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate , or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services , it could affect our ability to provide our services , the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads , which could adversely affect our financial results . we have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past , and proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future .",
        "943": "for example , we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the european general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) , and may implement additional changes in the future .",
        "944": "the gdpr also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead european union privacy regulator , the idpc , and includes significant penalties for non - compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation .",
        "945": "the interpretation of the gdpr is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the idpc are subject to review by other european privacy regulators as part of the gdpr ' s consistency mechanism , which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations .",
        "946": "as a result , the interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr , as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non - compliance , are subject to significant uncertainty .",
        "947": "in addition , brazil , the united kingdom , and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy - related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions .",
        "948": "the california consumer privacy act ( ccpa ) , as amended by the california privacy rights act ( cpra ) , also establishes certain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users , including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties .",
        "949": "other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls .",
        "950": "these laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation , and resulting limitations on our advertising services , or reductions of advertising by marketers , have to some extent adversely affected , and will continue to adversely affect , our advertising business .",
        "951": "for example , state regulators in california and colorado are considering adopting regulations that could further limit how companies can use personal information for advertising 81table of contentspurposes .",
        "952": "some states have also proposed or enacted privacy laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians .",
        "953": "like comprehensive privacy laws , these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation , and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states , adversely affecting our advertising business .",
        "954": "in europe , regulators continue to enforce guidance concerning the eprivacy directive ' s requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies , and may impose specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies .",
        "955": "in addition , the eprivacy directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non - compliance .",
        "956": "changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have in the past adversely affected , and may in the future adversely affect , our advertising business .",
        "957": "similarly , there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the european union , the united states , at both the federal and state level , as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business .",
        "958": "for example , the dma in the european union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours , including in areas such as the combination of data across services , mergers and acquisitions , and product design .",
        "959": "the dma also includes significant penalties for non - compliance , and its key requirements will be enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies in early 2024 .",
        "960": "we expect the dma will cause us to incur significant compliance costs and make additional changes to our products or business practices .",
        "961": "the requirements under the dma will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement .",
        "962": "pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in the united states and other jurisdictions could have similar effects .",
        "963": "further , the digital services act ( dsa ) in the european union , which will apply to our business as early as august 2023 , will impose new restrictions and requirements for our products and services and may significantly increase our compliance costs .",
        "964": "the dsa also includes significant penalties for non - compliance .",
        "965": "in addition , some countries , such as india and turkey , are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services , cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries , or result in fines or other penalties .",
        "966": "new legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions . these laws and regulations , as well as any associated claims , inquiries , or investigations or any other government actions , have in the past led to , and may in the future lead to , unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs , loss of revenue , delays or impediments in the development of new products , negative publicity and reputational harm , increased operating costs , diversion of management time and attention , and remedies that harm our business , including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices . we have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations , enforcement actions , and settlements , and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future , which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business .",
        "967": "we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations , many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation .",
        "968": "we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations , inquiries , data requests , requests for information , actions , and audits in the united states , europe , and around the world , particularly in the areas of privacy and data protection , including with respect to minors , law enforcement , consumer protection , civil rights , content moderation , and competition .",
        "969": "in addition , we are currently , and may in the future be , subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees .",
        "970": "for example , data protection , competition , and consumer protection authorities in the european union and other jurisdictions have initiated actions , investigations , or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information , or impose sanctions , and other authorities may do the same .",
        "971": "in addition , beginning in march 2018 , we became subject to ftc , state attorneys general , and other government inquiries in the united states , europe , and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies .",
        "972": "in july 2019 , we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the ftc inquiry , which took effect in april 2020 and , among other things , required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight .",
        "973": "the state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing .",
        "974": "the ftc also continues to monitor us and has put us on notice that they may bring additional proceedings related to our compliance with the order .",
        "975": "we also notify the idpc , our lead european union privacy regulator under the gdpr , and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues , and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the idpc and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance .",
        "976": "we have in the past been , and may in the future be , subject to penalties , fines , and requirements to change our business practices as a result of such inquiries and 82table of contentsinvestigations .",
        "977": "in addition , we are subject to a lawsuit by the state of texas in connection with the \" tag suggestions \" feature and other uses of facial recognition technology . we are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the united states , europe , and other jurisdictions , which relate to many aspects of our business , including with respect to users and advertisers , as well as our industry .",
        "978": "such inquiries , investigations , and lawsuits concern , among other things , our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services , digital advertising , and / or mobile or online applications , as well as our acquisitions .",
        "979": "for example , in june 2019 we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company .",
        "980": "in addition , beginning in the third quarter of 2019 , we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the u . s .",
        "981": "department of justice and state attorneys general .",
        "982": "beginning in december 2020 , we also became subject to lawsuits by the ftc and the attorneys general from 46 & # 160 ; states , the territory of guam , and the district of columbia in the u . s .",
        "983": "district court for the district of columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws , including by acquiring instagram in 2012 and whatsapp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform , among other things .",
        "984": "the complaints of the ftc and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company ' s alleged violations of the antitrust laws , and other equitable relief , including divestiture or reconstruction of instagram and whatsapp .",
        "985": "in addition , in december 2022 , the european commission issued a statement of objections alleging that we tie facebook marketplace to facebook and use data in a manner that infringes european union competition rules .",
        "986": "we are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices .",
        "987": "for example , beginning in september 2021 , we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee . orders issued by , or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by , government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs , expose us to civil and criminal liability ( including liability for our personnel ) or penalties ( including substantial monetary remedies ) , interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business ( including changes to our products or user data practices ) , result in negative publicity and reputational harm , divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business , or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business , and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time . compliance with our ftc consent order , the gdpr , the cpra , the eprivacy directive , the dma , the dsa , and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices , and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business , reputation , and financial results . we are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts , including in connection with our modified consent order with the ftc , requirements of the gdpr , and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative requirements around the world , such as the cpra , eprivacy directive , dma , and dsa .",
        "988": "in particular , we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the ftc consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight , stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations , prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data , a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the ftc , and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third - party assessor , which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance .",
        "989": "these compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources , and require significant new and ongoing investments , including investments in compliance processes , personnel , and technical infrastructure .",
        "990": "we are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts , and this has had , and will continue to have , an adverse impact on our other business initiatives .",
        "991": "in addition , these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult , time - consuming , and costly .",
        "992": "as a result , we believe our ability to develop and launch new features , products , and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected .",
        "993": "we also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors .",
        "994": "the requirements of the ftc consent order and other privacy - related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business , and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues , and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future .",
        "995": "in addition , regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation .",
        "996": "for example , we will be subject to new restrictions and requirements under the dma , including in areas such as the combination of data across services and product design , which will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement .",
        "997": "if we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the ftc consent order , gdpr , cpra , eprivacy directive , dma , dsa , or other regulatory or legislative requirements , or if any relevant authority believes 83table of contentsthat we are in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements , we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits , which may result in significant monetary fines , judgments , penalties , or other remedies , and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices .",
        "998": "any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business , reputation , and financial results . we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products , and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and financial results . we have faced , currently face , and will continue to face claims and government inquiries relating to information or content that is published or made available on our products , including our policies , algorithms , and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content .",
        "999": "in particular , the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation , dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes , deceptive and fraudulent advertising , discrimination , harassment , intellectual property rights , rights of publicity and privacy , personal injury torts , laws regulating hate speech or other types of content , online safety , products liability , consumer protection , and breach of contract , among others .",
        "1000": "for example , we have recently seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well - being issues based on allegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products .",
        "1001": "the potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for third - party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states .",
        "1002": "for example , in april 2019 , the european union passed a directive ( the european copyright directive ) expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online , which member states are currently implementing into their national laws .",
        "1003": "in addition , the european union revised the european audiovisual media service directive to apply to online video - sharing platforms , which member states have begun to implement .",
        "1004": "supreme court recently heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section 230 of the communications decency act ( section 230 ) is at issue .",
        "1005": "there also have been , and continue to be , various state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections under section & # 160 ; 230 , as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings , user content , counterfeit goods and copyright - infringing material , and our current protections from liability for third - party content in the united states could decrease or change .",
        "1006": "we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and , if we are found liable , significant damages .",
        "1007": "we could also face fines , orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies , or other government - imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services .",
        "1008": "for example , legislation in germany and india has resulted in the past , and may result in the future , in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal , law enforcement cooperation , and disclosure obligations .",
        "1009": "numerous other countries in europe , the middle east , asia - pacific , and latin america are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing potentially significant penalties , including fines , service throttling , or advertising bans , for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes .",
        "1010": "for example , we have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in turkey , and we have been subject to fines and service blocking and prohibition in russia .",
        "1011": "content - related legislation also has required us in the past , and may require us in the future , to change our products or business practices , increase our costs , or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies .",
        "1012": "for example , the european copyright directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content , which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes .",
        "1013": "member states ' laws implementing the european copyright directive may also require online platforms to pay for content .",
        "1014": "in addition , our products and services will be subject to new restrictions and requirements , and our compliance costs may significantly increase , as a result of the digital services act in the european union , which will apply to our business as early as august 2023 , and potentially other content - related legislative developments such as proposed online safety bills in ireland and the united kingdom .",
        "1015": "certain countries have also proposed legislation that may require us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on our products .",
        "1016": "in the united states , changes to the protections available under section & # 160 ; 230 or the first amendment to the u . s .",
        "1017": "constitution or new state or federal content - related legislation may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products , business practices , or operations , which could adversely affect user growth and engagement .",
        "1018": "any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results . payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business . several of our products offer payments functionality , including enabling our users to purchase tangible , virtual , and digital goods from merchants and developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure , send money to other 84table of contentsusers , and make donations to certain charitable organizations , among other activities .",
        "1019": "we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states , europe , and elsewhere , including those governing anti - money laundering and counter - terrorist financing , money transmission , stored value , gift cards and other prepaid access instruments , electronic funds transfer , virtual currency , consumer protection , charitable fundraising , trade sanctions , and import and export restrictions . & # 160 ; depending on how our payments products evolve , we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling , banking , and lending .",
        "1020": "in some jurisdictions , the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear .",
        "1021": "to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty , we have received certain payments licenses in the united states , the european economic area , and other jurisdictions , which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas .",
        "1022": "our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance .",
        "1023": "in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements , we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order , or we may be required to make product changes , any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results . in addition , we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions , including : increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes ; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users , developers , employees , or third parties ; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact payments ; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements .",
        "1024": "we have also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the future undertake additional payments initiatives , including as part of our metaverse efforts , which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements . risks related to data , security , and intellectual propertysecurity breaches , improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data , other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems , or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business . our industry is prone to cyber - attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users ' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service .",
        "1025": "our products and services involve the collection , storage , processing , and transmission of a large amount of data .",
        "1026": "any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data , including personal information , content , or payment information from users , or information from marketers , could result in the loss , modification , disclosure , destruction , or other misuse of such data , which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position .",
        "1027": "in addition , computer malware , viruses , social engineering ( such as spear phishing attacks ) , scraping , and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry , have occurred on our systems in the past , and will occur on our systems in the future .",
        "1028": "we also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts , purchase ads , or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming , spreading misinformation , or other objectionable ends .",
        "1029": "as a result of our prominence , the size of our user base , the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems , and the evolving nature of our products and services ( including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies ) , we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks , including from nation states and highly sophisticated , state - sponsored , or otherwise well - funded actors , and we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events .",
        "1030": "our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks .",
        "1031": "such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide , degrade the user experience , cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products , impair our internal systems , or result in financial harm to us .",
        "1032": "our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive , and to disable undesirable activities on our platform , may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions ; employee , contractor , or vendor error or malfeasance , including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors ' information technology systems or offerings ; government surveillance ; breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure ; or other threats that evolve .",

        "1034": "cyber - attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume , and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time .",

        "1059": "in the united states and internationally , we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property , and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties .",

        "1068": "in addition , various \" non - practicing entities \" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies .",
        "1069": "furthermore , from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products , including in areas where we historically have not competed , which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non - practicing entities . from time to time , we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services , or user content , infringe their intellectual property rights .",
        "1070": "we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits , and as we face increasing competition and develop new products and services , we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow .",
        "1071": "defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees , and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases .",

        "1077": "as a result , we may also be required to develop alternative non - infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices .",
        "1078": "the development of alternative non - infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense , could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience , or may not be feasible .",

        "1083": "we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility .",
        "1084": "any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs , divert resources and the attention of management from our business , and adversely affect our business . we do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future . we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock .",

        "1086": "as a result , you may only receive a return on your investment in our class & # 160 ; a common stock if the trading price of your shares increases . the dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class & # 160 ; b common stock ; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters . our class & # 160 ; b common stock has ten votes per share and our class & # 160 ; a common stock has one vote per share .",
