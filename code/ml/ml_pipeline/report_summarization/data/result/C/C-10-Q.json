Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenues.&#8226;Citi&#8217;s expenses increased 1% versus the prior-year period, including divestiture-related impacts in both the current and prior-year periods (for additional information, see &#8220;First Quarter of 2023 Results Summary&#8221; below). Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, expenses increased 5%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, other risk and control investments, inflation and severance costs, all partially offset by the benefit of productivity savings, foreign exchange translation and expense reduction from the closed exit markets and wind-downs (for additional information, see &#8220;Expenses&#8221; below).&#8226;Citi&#8217;s cost of credit was $2.0 billion versus $0.8 billion in the prior-year period. The increase reflected a net build of $0.7 billion in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans and unfunded commitments and other provisions, compared to a net ACL release of $0.1 billion in the prior-year period, primarily driven by macroeconomic deterioration and growth in card revolving balances, and higher net credit losses, primarily driven by ongoing normalization in Branded cards and Retail services.&#8226;Citi returned $1.0 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends.&#8226;Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio increased to 13.4% as of March 31, 2023, compared to 11.4% as of March 31, 2022 (for additional information, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8221; below). This compares to Citi&#8217;s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.0% as of January 1, 2023 under the Basel III Standardized Approach. &#8226;Citi continued to make further progress on its consumer banking business divestitures in the first quarter of 2023, including, among other things, completing the sales of its India and Vietnam consumer banking businesses and working toward closing two additional sale transactions in 2023, as well as progressing with the continued wind-downs of the Korea and China consumer banking businesses and the Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses.First Quarter of 2023 Results SummaryCitigroupCitigroup reported net income of $4.6 billion, or $2.19 per share, compared to net income of $4.3 billion, or $2.02 per share in the prior-year period. The increase in net income was primarily driven by the higher revenues, partially offset by the higher expenses and the higher cost of credit. Citigroup&#8217;s effective tax rate was approximately 25% in the current quarter, including the impact of divestitures, versus 18% in the prior-year period, which had higher discrete tax benefits (for additional information, see &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; below). Earnings per share (EPS) increased 8%, reflecting the higher net income and an approximate 1% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. Results for the first quarter of 2023 included divestiture-related impacts of $953 million in earnings before taxes ($648 million after-tax), primarily recorded in Legacy Franchises, reflecting the following: &#8226;$1,018 million of net divestiture gains, primarily related to a gain on sale of the India consumer banking business, recorded in revenues &#8226;$73 million of aggregate divestiture-related costs, recorded in expenses&#8226;An $8 million benefit of divestiture-related credit costs&#8226;$305 million of related taxesThese divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a $0.33 positive impact on EPS in the current quarter. Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $1.86. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures.)Results for the first quarter of 2022 included divestiture-related impacts of $(677) million in earnings before taxes ($(588) million after-tax), recorded in Legacy Franchises, reflecting the following:&#8226;A $118 million pretax loss primarily related to the Asia markets, recorded in revenues; this pretax loss reflected an ACL release of $(104) million and a net revenue impact of $(14) million due to contractual adjustments&#8226;A $71 million cost of credit reclassification to revenues, as once a divestiture is classified as held-for-sale, credit costs, including ACL builds/releases and net credit losses, are reclassified to revenues&#8226;A $535 million goodwill impairment recorded in expenses, due to the re-segmentation and sequencing of divestitures, as well as $24 million of costs related to the Korea voluntary early retirement program, also recorded in expenses&#8226;$(89) million of related tax benefits3These divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a $(0.30) negative impact on EPS in the prior-year period. Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $2.32.Citigroup revenues of $21.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 increased 12% from the prior-year period. As discussed above, reported revenues included net divestiture gains of approximately $1.0 billion this quarter, primarily related to the gain on sale of the India consumer banking business, compared to a loss of $47 million primarily related to the Asia markets in the prior-year period, both recorded in Legacy Franchises. Excluding these impacts, revenues increased 6%, reflecting strength across Services and Fixed income markets in Institutional Clients Group (ICG), as well as strong average loan growth in U.S. Personal Banking in Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM). The higher revenues were partially offset by a decline in Investment banking and Equity markets in ICG and lower investment product revenues in Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth) in PBWM, as well as impacts from the closed exit markets and wind-downs in Legacy Franchises.Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period loans were $652 billion, down 1% versus the prior-year period, as growth in PBWM was more than offset by a decline in ICG and Legacy Franchises. Citigroup&#8217;s end-of-period deposits were approximately $1.3 trillion, largely unchanged versus the prior-year period, as a decrease in PBWM, largely reflecting Global Wealth clients reallocating deposits to higher-yielding investments on the business&#8217;s platform, was offset by an increase in institutional certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other. For additional information about Citi&#8217;s deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see each respective business&#8217;s results of operations and &#8220;Liquidity Risk&#8212;Deposits&#8221; below.ExpensesCitigroup&#8217;s operating expenses of $13.3 billion increased 1% from the prior-year period. As discussed above, reported operating expenses included $73 million of divestiture-related costs this quarter, compared to $559 million in the prior-year period, both recorded in Legacy Franchises. Excluding these divestiture-related costs, expenses increased 5%, largely driven by the following:&#8226;Approximately 1% by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, largely related to risk and controls, data and finance programs.&#8226;Approximately 4% by structural expenses, largely in compensation and benefits, which included the full-year impact of hiring in the prior year, as well as hiring in the first quarter of 2023; and the impact of inflation and severance costs.The increase in expenses was partially offset by productivity savings, lower business-led investments and the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as expense reduction from the closed exit markets and wind-downs in Legacy Franchises.As previously announced, Citi expects to incur higher expenses in 2023, primarily reflecting continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, other risk and control investments, volume-related expenses and inflation.Cost of CreditCiti&#8217;s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a cost of $2.0 billion, compared to $0.8 billion in the prior-year period. This increase reflected higher net credit losses (see below) and a net build of $0.7 billion in the ACL for loans and unfunded commitments and other provisions, primarily driven by macroeconomic deterioration and growth in card revolving balances in PBWM. This compared to a net ACL release and other provisions of $(0.1) billion in the prior-year period. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8212;Citi&#8217;s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)&#8221; below. Net credit losses of $1.3 billion increased 49% from the prior year. Consumer net credit losses of $1.3 billion increased 52%, reflecting ongoing normalization, particularly in Branded cards and Retail services. Corporate net credit losses decreased to $22 million from $31 million. Citi also expects to incur higher net credit losses in 2023, primarily driven by continued normalization toward pre-pandemic levels, particularly in the cards business in PBWM.For additional information on Citi&#8217;s consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business&#8217;s results of operations and &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; below.CapitalCitigroup&#8217;s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.4% as of March 31, 2023, compared to 11.4% as of March 31, 2022, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by net income, the impacts from the closing of the Asia consumer banking business sales, and business actions, including a reduction in RWA, partially offset by the payment of common dividends.Citigroup&#8217;s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of March 31, 2023 was 6.0%, compared to 5.6% as of March 31, 2022. The increase was driven by higher Tier 1 Capital, partially offset by a slight increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s capital ratios and related components, see &#8220;Capital Resources&#8221; below.During the first quarter of 2023, Citi continued to pause common share repurchases, in anticipation of any temporary capital impacts related to any potential signing of a sale agreement for its Mexico Consumer/SBMM businesses (for additional information, see &#8220;Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties&#8221; and the capital return risk factor in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K) and to continue to have ample capital to serve its clients.Institutional Clients GroupICG net income of $3.3 billion increased 23%, primarily driven by lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. ICG operating expenses of $7.0 billion increased 4%, largely driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, other risk and control investments, volume-related expenses and other structural expenses, including severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation.4ICG revenues of $11.2 billion increased 1% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), as strength in Treasury and trade solutions (TTS), Securities services and Fixed income markets was partially offset by declines in Banking and Equity markets. Results included a loss on loan hedges of $199 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with a gain on loan hedges of $169 million in the prior-year period.Services revenues of $4.5 billion increased 29%. TTS revenues of $3.4 billion increased 31%, driven by 41% growth in net interest income and 13% growth in non-interest revenue. Strong performance in TTS was driven by higher interest rates and business actions, including growth in deposits, managing repricing and growth in fees. Securities services revenues of $1.1 billion increased 23%, as net interest income increased 94%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and were partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of lower settlement volumes and lower market valuations on assets under custody and administration.Markets revenues of $5.6 billion decreased 4%, as growth in Fixed income markets was more than offset by a decline in Equity markets. Fixed income markets revenues of $4.5 billion increased 4%, primarily driven by strength in rates and currencies, partially offset by lower revenues in spread products and other fixed income. Equity markets revenues of $1.1 billion declined 25%, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in cash and equity derivatives relative to a strong quarter in the prior-year period.Banking revenues of $1.2 billion decreased 38%, including the gain (loss) on loan hedges in the current quarter and the prior-year period. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Banking revenues of $1.4 billion decreased 21%, driven by lower revenues in Investment banking and Corporate lending. Investment banking revenues of $774 million decreased 25%, reflecting a decline in the overall market wallet, as continued geopolitical uncertainty, heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. Corporate lending revenues decreased 54%, including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate lending revenues decreased 14% versus the prior-year period, driven by lower volumes and higher hedging costs. For additional information on the results of operations of ICG for the first quarter of 2023, see &#8220;Institutional Clients Group&#8221; below.Personal Banking and Wealth ManagementPBWM net income of $489 million decreased 74%, driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. PBWM operating expenses of $4.3 billion increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, other risk and control investments and severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings.PBWM revenues of $6.4 billion increased 9%, primarily due to higher net interest income, driven by strong loan growth across U.S. Personal Banking, partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue, primarily driven by lower investment product revenues in Global Wealth.U.S. Personal Banking revenues of $4.7 billion increased 18%. Branded cards revenues of $2.5 billion increased 18%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income, as card spend volume increased 9% and average loans increased 15%. Retail services revenues of $1.6 billion increased 24%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income. Retail banking revenues of $613 million increased 3%, primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposit balances to Global Wealth.Global Wealth revenues of $1.8 billion decreased 9%, largely driven by investment product revenue headwinds and higher interest rates paid on deposits, particularly in the Private bank.For additional information on the results of operations of PBWM for the first quarter of 2023, see &#8220;Personal Banking and Wealth Management&#8221; below.Legacy FranchisesLegacy Franchises net income was $604 million, compared to a net loss of $383 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Legacy Franchises revenues of $2.9 billion increased 48%, primarily driven by the gain on sale of the India consumer banking business, partially offset by the absence of the closed exit markets and wind-downs. Legacy Franchises expenses of $1.8 billion decreased 24%, largely driven by the absence of the goodwill impairment in Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer) recorded in the prior-year period and the benefit of the closed exit markets and wind-downs.For additional information on the results of operations of Legacy Franchises for the first quarter of 2023, see &#8220;Legacy Franchises&#8221; below.Corporate/Other Corporate/Other net income was $255 million, compared to $189 million in the prior-year period, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit, higher expenses and lower income tax benefits. Corporate/Other operating expenses of $310 million increased 19%, driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by lower consulting expenses. Corporate/Other revenues of $914 million increased from $190 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher net interest income. The higher net interest income was primarily due to the investment portfolio, largely driven by higher interest rates. For additional information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other for the first quarter of 2023, see &#8220;Corporate/Other&#8221; below.Macroeconomic and Other Risks and UncertaintiesVarious geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely impact economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including continued elevated levels of inflation, central banks continuing to increase interest rates, recent bank failures and related volatility, uncertainty with respect to raising the U.S. federal 5debt limit, and economic and geopolitical challenges related to China and the Russia&#8211;Ukraine war. These and other factors have adversely affected financial markets, negatively impacted global economic growth rates and increased the risk of recession in the U.S., Europe and other countries. These and other factors could adversely affect Citi&#8217;s customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, expenses and overall results of operations and financial condition during the remainder of 2023.For example, on April 18, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that in May 2023, it will propose a special assessment to recover the uninsured deposit losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. On May 1, 2023, the FDIC announced that its Deposit Insurance Fund will incur additional costs related to the resolution of First Republic Bank. The FDIC did not indicate how it proposes covering these costs, but First Republic Bank was not resolved under special emergency provisions. Citibank, N.A. could incur an increase in its non-interest expense from the imposition of additional costs by the FDIC, although the amount of such costs is not yet known or reasonably estimable. In addition, Citi could incur a significant loss on sale due to currency translation adjustment (CTA) losses (net of hedges) in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), allocated goodwill and intangibles and other AOCI loss components related to the potential signing of a sale agreement for its remaining consumer banking divestitures. The majority of these losses would be regulatory capital neutral at closing.For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact Citi&#8217;s businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial condition during the remainder of 2023, see &#8220;First Quarter of 2023 Results Summary&#8221; above and each respective business&#8217;s results of operations, &#8220;Managing Global Risk,&#8221; including &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Other Risks&#8212;Country Risk&#8212;Russia&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Argentina,&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; below and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.6This page intentionally left blank.7RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATACitigroup Inc. and Consolidated SubsidiariesFirst QuarterIn millions of dollars, except per share amounts20232022% ChangeNet interest income$13,348&#160;$10,871&#160;23&#160;%Non-interest revenue8,099&#160;8,315&#160;(3)Revenues, net of interest expense$21,447&#160;$19,186&#160;12&#160;%Operating expenses13,289&#160;13,165&#160;1&#160;Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims1,975&#160;755&#160;NMIncome from continuing operations before income taxes$6,183&#160;$5,266&#160;17&#160;%Income taxes1,531&#160;941&#160;63&#160;Income from continuing operations$4,652&#160;$4,325&#160;8&#160;%Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes(1)(2)50&#160;Net income before attribution of noncontrolling interests$4,651&#160;$4,323&#160;8&#160;%Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests45&#160;17&#160;NMCitigroup&#8217;s net income$4,606&#160;$4,306&#160;7&#160;%Earnings per shareBasicIncome from continuing operations$2.21&#160;$2.03&#160;9&#160;%Net income2.21&#160;2.03&#160;9&#160;Diluted Income from continuing operations$2.19&#160;$2.02&#160;8&#160;%Net income2.19&#160;2.02&#160;8&#160;Dividends declared per common share 0.51&#160;0.51&#160;&#8212;&#160;Common dividends $1,000&#160;$1,014&#160;(1)%Preferred dividends(1)277&#160;279&#160;(1)Common share repurchases&#8212;&#160;3,000&#160;NMTable continues on the next page, including footnotes.8SUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA(Continued)Citigroup Inc. and Consolidated SubsidiariesIn millions of dollars, except per share amounts, ratios and direct staffFirst Quarter20232022% ChangeAt March 31:Total assets$2,455,113&#160;$2,394,105&#160;3&#160;%Total deposits 1,330,459&#160;1,333,711&#160;&#8212;&#160;Long-term debt279,684&#160;253,954&#160;10&#160;Citigroup common stockholders&#8217; equity188,050&#160;178,714&#160;5&#160;Total Citigroup stockholders&#8217; equity208,295&#160;197,709&#160;5&#160;Average assets2,462,244&#160;2,374,040&#160;4&#160;Direct staff (in thousands)240&#160;228&#160;5&#160;%Performance metricsReturn on average assets0.76&#160;%0.74&#160;%Return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity(2)9.5&#160;9.0&#160;Return on average total stockholders&#8217; equity(2)9.2&#160;8.7&#160;Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE)(3)10.9&#160;10.5&#160;Efficiency ratio (total operating expenses/total revenues, net)62.0&#160;68.6&#160;Basel III ratiosCET1 Capital(4)(5)13.44&#160;%11.43&#160;%Tier 1 Capital(4)(5)15.31&#160;13.05&#160;Total Capital(4)15.57&#160;14.84&#160;Supplementary Leverage ratio(4)5.96&#160;5.58&#160;Citigroup common stockholders&#8217; equity to assets7.66&#160;%7.46&#160;%Total Citigroup stockholders&#8217; equity to assets8.48&#160;8.26&#160;Dividend payout ratio(6)23&#160;25&#160;Total payout ratio(7)23&#160;100&#160;Book value per common share$96.59&#160;$92.03&#160;5&#160;%Tangible book value (TBV) per share(3)84.21&#160;79.03&#160;7&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certain series of preferred stock have semiannual payment dates.

ICG provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, cash management, trade finance and securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products. For more information on ICG&#8217;s business activities, see &#8220;Institutional Clients Group&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. ICG&#8217;s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 countries and jurisdictions. As part of previously disclosed plans, Citi has ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia as of March 31, 2023, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In connection with this wind-down, Citi expects to incur approximately $210 million in total estimated charges (excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), of which $60 million relates to ICG. For additional information about Citi&#8217;s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see &#8220;Legacy Franchises&#8221; and &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Other Risks&#8212;Country Risk&#8212;Russia&#8221; below.At March&#160;31, 2023, ICG had $1.8 trillion in assets and $819 billion in deposits. Securities services managed $23.0 trillion in assets under custody and administration at March&#160;31, 2023, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients related to $1.9 trillion of such assets. Managed assets under trust were $3.9 trillion at March&#160;31, 2023.

For example, securities that generate Net interest income may be risk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue within Non-interest revenue. For a description of the composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6.(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup&#8217;s results of operations excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.NM Not meaningful13The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.1Q23 vs. 1Q22Net income of $3.3 billion increased 23%, primarily driven by lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses.Revenues increased 1% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), driven by higher Services revenues, partially offset by lower Banking and Markets revenues. Services revenues were up 29%, driven by higher revenues in both TTS and Securities services. Banking revenues were down 38% (including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges), reflecting lower revenues in both Investment banking and Corporate lending. Markets revenues were down 4%, driven by Equity markets, partially offset by higher Fixed income markets revenues.Within Services:&#8226;TTS revenues increased 31%, driven by 41% growth in net interest income and 13% growth in non-interest revenue, reflecting strong growth across all client segments. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates and business actions, including growth in deposits and managing repricing. Average deposits increased 5%, largely driven by growth in EMEA and North America. Average loans decreased 2%, largely reflecting loans sales, primarily in North America. The increase in non-interest revenue was primarily due to strong fee growth across both the cash and trade businesses, reflecting solid client engagement and continued growth of underlying drivers, with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 6%, cross-border flows up 10% and commercial card spend up 40%.&#8226;Securities services revenues increased 23%, as net interest income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. The increase in revenues was partially offset by lower non-interest revenues (decrease of 6%), driven by lower settlement volumes (decline of 3%), along with lower market valuations on assets under custody and administration. The decline in non-interest revenue was partially offset by higher existing client activity and new client onboarding and continued elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer services.Within Markets:&#8226;Fixed income markets revenues increased 4%, driven by growth in rates and currencies, primarily in North America, partially offset by a decline in spread products and other fixed income, primarily in North America and EMEA.Rates and currencies increased 13%, driven by the rates business, reflecting increased interest rate volatility, partially offset by a decline in the currencies business due to a strong prior-year comparison. Spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 24%, due to decreased institutional and corporate client activity in spread products and a decline in commodities, primarily in North America, driven by decreased volatility against a strong prior-year comparison. &#8226;Equity markets revenues decreased 25%, driven by equity derivatives, primarily reflecting lower activity in both corporate and institutional clients compared to a strong prior-year period. The lower revenues also reflected a decline in equity cash, driven by lower institutional client activity. Prime finance balances continued to grow in the quarter. Within Banking:&#8226;Investment banking revenues declined 25%, reflecting a decline in the overall market wallet, as continued geopolitical uncertainty, heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. Advisory revenues decreased 17%, reflecting a decline in North America and Asia, partially offset by growth in EMEA. The decrease in advisory revenues was driven by the lower market wallet, partially offset by wallet share gains. Equity underwriting revenues decreased 41%, reflecting a decline in North America, Asia and EMEA, driven by the decline in the market wallet as well as wallet share loss. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 24%, reflecting a decline in North America and EMEA, driven by the decline in the market wallet, partially offset by wallet share gains largely in the investment-grade portfolio.&#8226;Corporate lending revenues decreased 54%, including the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 14%, primarily driven by lower volumes and higher hedging costs. Expenses increased 4%, primarily driven by continued investment in Citi&#8217;s transformation, other risk and control investments, volume-related expenses and other structural expenses, including severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Provisions reflected a benefit of $72 million, compared to costs of $971 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by an ACL release for loans and unfunded lending commitments and other provisions, compared to an ACL build in the prior-year period. Net credit losses were $22 million, compared to $30 million in the prior-year period.The ACL release was $94 million, compared to a build of $941 million in the prior-year period. The year-over-year decrease in the ACL build was due to the absence of Russia-related ACL builds in the prior-year period. The $94 million ACL release for the quarter was driven by a net ACL release for loans and unfunded lending commitments of $245 million, primarily due to reductions in Russia loan exposures, partially offset by $151 million related to an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8221; below.14For additional information on ICG&#8217;s corporate credit portfolio, see &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Credit Risk&#8212;Corporate Credit&#8221; below.For additional information on trends in ICG&#8217;s deposits and loans, see &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Liquidity Risk&#8212;Loans&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Deposits&#8221; below.For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to ICG&#8217;s future results, see &#8220;Executive Summary&#8221; above, &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Other Risks&#8212;Country Risk&#8212;Argentina&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Russia&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; below and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.15PERSONAL BANKING AND WEALTH MANAGEMENTPersonal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM) consists of U.S. Personal Banking and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth). U.S. Personal Banking includes Branded cards and Retail services, which have the following proprietary cards portfolios: Cash, Rewards and Value portfolios and co-branded cards within Branded cards (including American Airlines and Costco), and co-brand and private label relationships within Retail services (including, among others, The Home Depot, Best Buy, Sears and Macy&#8217;s). U.S. Personal Banking also includes Retail banking, which provides traditional banking services to retail and small business customers. Global Wealth includes Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold and provides financial services to clients from affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through banking, lending, mortgages, investment, custody and trust product offerings in 20 countries, including the U.S., Mexico and four wealth management centers: Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London.At March 31, 2023, U.S. Personal Banking had 653 retail bank branches concentrated in the six key metropolitan areas of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Washington, D.C. U.S. Personal Banking had $146 billion in outstanding credit card balances, $115 billion in deposits and $39 billion in retail banking loans.At March 31, 2023, Global Wealth had $322 billion in deposits, $85 billion in mortgage loans, $60 billion in personal and small business loans and $4 billion in outstanding credit card balances.First QuarterIn millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted20232022% ChangeNet interest income$5,934&#160;$5,385&#160;10&#160;%Non-interest revenue514&#160;520&#160;(1)Total revenues, net of interest expense$6,448&#160;$5,905&#160;9&#160;%Total operating expenses$4,254&#160;$3,889&#160;9&#160;%Net credit losses on loans$1,094&#160;$691&#160;58&#160;%Credit reserve build (release) for loans507&#160;(1,062)NMProvision (release) for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments(6)(2)NMProvisions for benefits and claims (PBC), and other assets(4)(3)(33)Provisions (releases) for credit losses and PBC$1,591&#160;$(376)NMIncome from continuing operations before taxes$603&#160;$2,392&#160;(75)%Income taxes114&#160;532&#160;(79)Income from continuing operations$489&#160;$1,860&#160;(74)%Noncontrolling interests&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Net income$489&#160;$1,860&#160;(74)%Balance Sheet data (in billions of dollars)EOP assets$490&#160;$476&#160;3&#160;%Average assets495&#160;474&#160;4&#160;Average loans333&#160;312&#160;7&#160;Average deposits434&#160;447&#160;(3)Efficiency ratio66&#160;%66&#160;%Net credit losses as a percentage of average loans1.33&#160;0.90&#160;Revenue by reporting unit and componentBranded cards$2,466&#160;$2,090&#160;18&#160;%Retail services1,613&#160;1,299&#160;24&#160;Retail banking613&#160;595&#160;3&#160;U.S. Personal Banking$4,692&#160;$3,984&#160;18&#160;%Private bank$567&#160;$779&#160;(27)%Wealth at Work193&#160;183&#160;5&#160;Citigold996&#160;959&#160;4&#160;Global Wealth$1,756&#160;$1,921&#160;(9)%Total$6,448&#160;$5,905&#160;9&#160;%NM Not meaningful161Q23 vs. 1Q22 Net income was $489 million, compared to $1.9 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.Revenues increased 9%, primarily due to higher net interest income, driven by strong loan growth across U.S. Personal Banking. The increase was partially offset by lower non-interest revenue, primarily reflecting lower investment product revenues in Global Wealth. U.S. Personal Banking revenues increased 18%, reflecting higher revenues in both cards and Retail banking.Cards revenues increased 20%. Branded cards revenues increased 18%, primarily driven by higher net interest income on higher card spend volumes and higher loan balances. Branded cards new account acquisitions increased 17% and card spend volumes increased 9%. Average loans increased 15%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes and lower payment rates.Retail services revenues increased 24%, primarily driven by higher net interest income on higher loan balances. Retail services card spend volumes decreased 3% and average loans increased 10%, reflecting lower payment rates. Retail banking revenues increased 3%, primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposit balances to Global Wealth. Average loans increased 14%, primarily driven by higher mortgage originations. Average deposits decreased 6%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposit balances to Global Wealth.Global Wealth revenues decreased 9%, largely reflecting investment product revenue headwinds and lower net interest income in the Private bank. Average deposits decreased 2% and average loans decreased 1%. The decline in average deposits largely reflected Global Wealth clients reallocating deposits to higher-yielding investments on the business&#8217;s platform, partially offset by the transfer of deposit relationships from Retail banking. Client assets decreased 4%, driven by declines in equity market valuations and lower deposits. Global Wealth continued to grow client advisors, which increased 3%. Private bank revenues decreased 27%, driven by the investment product revenue headwinds and higher interest rates paid on deposits. In addition, Wealth at Work revenues increased 5% and Citigold revenues increased 4%. Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in Citi&#8217;s transformation, other risk and control investments and severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings.Provisions were $1.6 billion, compared to a benefit of $376 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by a net ACL build for loans and higher net credit losses. Net credit losses increased 58%, reflecting ongoing normalization from historically low levels, particularly in Branded cards (net credit losses up 72% to $521 million) and Retail services (net credit losses up 95% to $491 million). The net ACL build was $0.5 billion, compared to a net release of $1.1 billion in the prior-year period, primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in U.S. cards revolving balances. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s ACL, see &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8221; below.For additional information on U.S. Personal Banking&#8217;s Branded cards, Retail services and Retail banking portfolios, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8212;Consumer Credit&#8221; below.For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to PBWM&#8217;s future results, see &#8220;Executive Summary&#8221; above and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; below, and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Strategic Risks&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.17LEGACY FRANCHISESAs of March 31, 2023, Legacy Franchises included (i) Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), representing the consumer banking operations of the remaining six Asia and EMEA exit countries, (ii) Mexico Consumer Banking (Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small Business and Middle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/SBMM, and (iii) Legacy Holdings Assets (certain North America consumer mortgage loans and other legacy assets). Asia Consumer provides traditional retail banking and branded card products to retail and small business customers. Mexico Consumer/SBMM provides traditional retail banking and branded card products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to commercial customers through Citibanamex. Legacy Franchises also included the following seven consumer banking businesses prior to their sale: Australia, until its closing on June 1, 2022; the Philippines, until its closing on August 1, 2022; Thailand and Malaysia, until their closings on November 1, 2022; Bahrain, until its closing on December 1, 2022; and India and Vietnam, until their closings on March 1, 2023. In addition, Citi has entered into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Indonesia and Taiwan, and has continued to make progress on its wind-downs of consumer banking operations in Korea and China and consumer banking and local commercial banking operations in Russia (see below). See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises&#8217; consumer banking business sales and wind-downs. In connection with Citi&#8217;s consumer and local commercial banking wind-down in Russia, Citi expects to incur approximately $210 million in total estimated charges (excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), of which $150 million relates to Legacy Franchises, largely driven by restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. Citi&#8217;s previously disclosed referral agreement with a Russian bank to settle a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject to customer consents, can be terminated under certain circumstances and is being reevaluated as Citi reviews other alternatives. The credit card loans will remain held-for-investment as Citi continues to explore pathways to accelerate the wind-down in a manner that is compliant with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements. For additional information about Citi&#8217;s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see &#8220;Institutional Clients Group&#8221; above and &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Other Risks&#8212;Country Risk&#8212;Russia&#8221; below, as well as &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.At March 31, 2023, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises had 1,406 retail branches, $20 billion in retail banking loans and $53 billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $9 billion in outstanding card loan balances, and Mexico SBMM had $8 billion in outstanding corporate loan balances. These loan and deposit amounts exclude approximately $10 billion of loans ($9 billion of retail banking loans and $1 billion of credit card loan balances) and approximately $11 billion of deposits, all of which were reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) (e.g., as Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) as a result of Citi&#8217;s entry into agreements to sell certain remaining consumer banking businesses.

Results for the first quarter of 2023 included divestiture-related impacts of $953 million in earnings before taxes ($648 million after-tax), recorded in Legacy Franchises, reflecting the following: &#8226;$1,018 million of net divestiture gains, primarily related to a gain on sale of the India consumer banking business, recorded in other revenue &#8226;$73 million of aggregate divestiture-related costs, recorded in expenses&#8226;An $8 million benefit of divestiture-related credit costs&#8226;$305 million of related taxesResults for the first quarter of 2022 included divestiture-related impacts of $(677) million ($(588) million after-tax), recorded in Legacy Franchises, reflecting the following:&#8226;A $118 million pretax loss primarily related to the Asia markets, recorded in revenues; this pretax loss reflected an ACL release of $(104) million and a net revenue impact of $(14) million due to contractual adjustments&#8226;A $71 million cost of credit reclassification to revenues, as once a divestiture is classified as held-for-sale, credit costs, including ACL builds/releases and net credit losses, are reclassified to revenues&#8226;A $535 million goodwill impairment, recorded in expenses, due to the re-segmentation and sequencing of divestitures, as well as $24 million of costs related to the Korea voluntary early retirement program, also recorded in expenses&#8226;$(89) million of related tax benefitsRevenues increased 48%, primarily driven by higher revenues in Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer/SBMM. Asia Consumer revenues of $1.5 billion increased from $787 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by the India gain on sale, partially offset by the absence of closed exit markets and wind-downs. Mexico Consumer/SBMM revenues increased 16%, as cards revenues increased 29%, SBMM revenues increased 18% and retail banking revenues increased 11%, primarily due to the benefit of FX translation as well as higher interest rates and higher lending volumes. Legacy Holdings Assets revenues were largely unchanged.Expenses decreased 24%, primarily driven by the absence of the goodwill impairment in the prior-year period and the benefit of the closed exit markets and wind-downs. Provisions were $345 million, compared to $160 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by an increase of $174 million due to a reserve build related to macroeconomic deterioration and an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. The higher cost of credit was also driven by higher net credit losses, primarily reflecting higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer.For additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to Legacy Franchises&#8217; future results, see &#8220;Executive Summary&#8221; above, &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Other Risks&#8212;Country Risk&#8212;Russia&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; below and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Strategic Risks&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.19CORPORATE/OTHER Activities not assigned to the operating segments (ICG, PBWM and Legacy Franchises) are included in Corporate/Other. Corporate/Other included certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance-related costs), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as results of Corporate Treasury investment activities and discontinued operations. At March 31, 2023, Corporate/Other had $102 billion in assets, including Corporate Treasury investment securities and the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets (DTAs). During the first quarter of 2023, Citi placed a $5 billion uninsured deposit with First Republic Bank, classified as Deposits with banks. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan), as part of its purchase of certain assets and liabilities of First Republic Bank, assumed all of the deposits of First Republic Bank.

Revenues were $914 million, compared to $190 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, largely due to higher interest rates. Expenses increased 19%, primarily driven by transformation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by lower consulting expenses.

For additional information, see &#8220;Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends&#8221; below. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio Citi&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.4% as of March&#160;31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.0% as of such date under the Standardized Approach. This compares to a CET1 Capital ratio of 13.0% as of December&#160;31, 2022, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 11.5% as of such date under the Standardized Approach.Citi&#8217;s CET1 Capital ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approaches was 12.3% as of March&#160;31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.5% as of such date under the Advanced Approaches framework. This compares to a CET1 Capital ratio of 12.2% as of December&#160;31, 2022, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.0% as of such date under the Advanced Approaches framework.Citi&#8217;s CET1 Capital ratio increased under both the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches from December&#160;31, 2022, driven primarily by net income, beneficial net movements in AOCI and impacts from the closing of the Asia consumer banking business sales, partially offset by the payment of common dividends. The increase in CET1 Capital under the Advanced Approaches was partially offset by an increase in Advanced Approaches RWA.Stress Capital Buffer In August 2022, the Federal Reserve Board finalized and announced Citi&#8217;s Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement of 4.0% for the four-quarter window starting from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023.In addition, as previously disclosed, commencing January 1, 2023, Citi&#8217;s GSIB surcharge increased from 3.0% to 3.5%, which is applicable to both the Standardized and the Advanced Approaches.Accordingly, as of January 1, 2023, Citi is required to maintain a 12.0% required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Standardized Approach, incorporating the 4.0% SCB and its current GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. Citi&#8217;s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) increased to 10.5%. The SCB applies to Citigroup only; the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unaffected by Citigroup&#8217;s SCB.

DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from CET1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary differences are required to be deducted from capital only if they exceed 10%/15% limitations under the U.S. Basel III rules.Footnotes continue on the following page.23(5)Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

(7)Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework were $4.9 billion and $4.7 billion at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively.24Citigroup Capital RollforwardIn millions of dollarsThree Months EndedMarch 31, 2023CET1 Capital, beginning of period$148,930&#160;Net income4,606&#160;Common and preferred dividends declared(1,277)Net decrease in treasury stock705&#160;Net decrease in common stock and additional paid-in capital(84)Net change in CTA net of hedges, net of tax842&#160;Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on debt securities AFS, net of tax836&#160;Net increase in defined benefit plans liability adjustment, net of tax(104)Net change in adjustment related to change in fair value of financial liabilities attributable to own creditworthiness, net of tax78&#160;Net decrease in excluded component of fair value hedges12&#160;Net decrease in goodwill, net of related DTLs163&#160;Net increase in identifiable intangible assets other than MSRs, net of related DTLs(196)Net decrease in defined benefit pension plan net assets7&#160;Net decrease in DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-forwards414&#160;Net increase in excess over 10%/15% limitations for other DTAs, certain common stock investments and MSRs(720)Net decrease in CECL transition provision(757)Other298&#160;Net increase in CET1 Capital$4,823&#160;CET1 Capital, end of period (Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches) $153,753&#160;Additional Tier 1 Capital, beginning of period$20,215&#160;Net increase in qualifying perpetual preferred stock1,245&#160;Net increase in qualifying trust preferred securities2&#160;Other34&#160;Net increase in Additional Tier 1 Capital $1,281&#160;Tier 1 Capital, end of period (Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches) $175,249&#160;Tier 2 Capital, beginning of period (Standardized Approach)$28,398&#160;Net decrease in qualifying subordinated debt(350)Net increase in eligible allowance for credit losses50&#160;Other239&#160;Net decrease in Tier 2 Capital (Standardized Approach)$(61)Tier 2 Capital, end of period (Standardized Approach) $28,337&#160;Total Capital, end of period (Standardized Approach)$203,586&#160;Tier 2 Capital, beginning of period (Advanced Approaches)$19,694&#160;Net decrease in qualifying subordinated debt(350)Net increase in excess of eligible credit reserves over expected credit losses166&#160;Other 239&#160;Net increase in Tier 2 Capital (Advanced Approaches)$55&#160;Tier 2 Capital, end of period (Advanced Approaches)$19,749&#160;Total Capital, end of period (Advanced Approaches)$194,998&#160;25Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward (Basel III Standardized Approach)In millions of dollarsThree Months EndedMarch 31, 2023Total Risk-Weighted Assets, beginning of period$1,142,985&#160;Changes in Credit Risk-Weighted AssetsGeneral credit risk exposures(1)(14,352)Derivatives1,157&#160;Repo-style transactions(2)10,925&#160;Securitization exposures456&#160;Equity exposures1,788&#160;Other exposures(3)2,144&#160;Net increase in Credit Risk-Weighted Assets$2,118&#160;Changes in Market Risk-Weighted AssetsRisk levels$(2,082)Model and methodology updates1,338&#160;Net increase in Market Risk-Weighted Assets$(744)Total Risk-Weighted Assets, end of period$1,144,359&#160;(1)General credit risk exposures include cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities, and loans and leases.

(5)Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. As presented in the table above, Citigroup&#8217;s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 6.0% at March&#160;31, 2023, compared to 5.8% at December&#160;31, 2022. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by an increase in Tier 1 Capital due to net income in the first quarter of 2023, issuance of qualifying perpetual preferred stock and beneficial net movements in AOCI, partially offset by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure.28Capital Resources of Citigroup&#8217;s Subsidiary U.S. Depository Institutions Citigroup&#8217;s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the Federal Reserve Board.

(7)Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.As indicated in the table above, Citibank&#8217;s capital ratios at March&#160;31, 2023 were in excess of the regulatory capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; as of March&#160;31, 2023.As presented in the table above, Citibank&#8217;s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.0% at March&#160;31, 2023, compared to 6.9% at December&#160;31, 2022. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by an increase in Tier 1 Capital due to net income in the first quarter of 2023 and beneficial net movements in AOCI, partially offset by dividends and an increase in Total Leverage Exposure. 29Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital RatiosThe following tables present the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup&#8217;s and Citibank&#8217;s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of March&#160;31, 2023. This information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup&#8217;s or Citibank&#8217;s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure.

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom&#8217;s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total regulatory capital of $28 billion at March&#160;31, 2023, which exceeded the PRA&#8217;s minimum regulatory capital requirements. In addition, certain of Citi&#8217;s other broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent.

Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi&#8217;s Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership Principles that support it, as well as Citi&#8217;s risk appetite.

The following table shows the percentage of this portfolio by region based on Citi&#8217;s internal management geography:March 31,2023December 31, 2022March 31,2022North America56&#160;%56&#160;%56&#160;%EMEA25&#160;25&#160;25&#160;Asia12&#160;12&#160;13&#160;Latin America7&#160;7&#160;6&#160;Total100&#160;%100&#160;%100&#160;%The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated statistical models and scorecards in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade.35The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio:&#160;Total exposure&#160;March 31,2023December 31,2022March 31,2022AAA/AA/A50&#160;%50&#160;%49&#160;%BBB33&#160;34&#160;33&#160;BB/B15&#160;14&#160;16&#160;CCC or below2&#160;2&#160;2&#160;Total100&#160;%100&#160;%100&#160;%Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments. In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi&#8217;s interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; definition of criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic environment. Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of March&#160;31, 2023. Citi has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where additional stress has been seen. As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi&#8217;s seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.See Note 13 for additional information on Citi&#8217;s corporate credit portfolio.Portfolio Mix&#8212;IndustryCiti&#8217;s corporate credit portfolio is diversified by industry.

Of the $39.8 billion of purchased credit protection, $36.6 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $3.2 billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of $27.6 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.(4)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $17.4 billion ($10.3 billion in funded, with more than 99% rated investment grade) as of December&#160;31, 2022.(5)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of December&#160;31, 2022, Citi&#8217;s total exposure to these energy-related entities was approximately $4.7 billion, of which approximately $2.4 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.38Credit Risk MitigationAs part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.At March&#160;31, 2023, December&#160;31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, ICG had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $39.8 billion, $39.8 billion and $37.9 billion, respectively. Citi&#8217;s expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying ICG corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:Rating of Hedged ExposureMarch 31,2023December 31,2022March 31,2022AAA/AA/A42&#160;%39&#160;%38&#160;%BBB44&#160;45&#160;46&#160;BB/B11&#160;12&#160;13&#160;CCC or below3&#160;4&#160;3&#160;Total100&#160;%100&#160;%100&#160;%39CONSUMER CREDIT Consumer Credit PortfolioThe following table shows Citi&#8217;s quarterly end-of-period consumer loans(1):In billions of dollars1Q22(2)2Q22(2)3Q22(2)4Q22(2)1Q23(2)Personal Banking and Wealth ManagementU.S. Personal BankingCardsBranded cards$85.9&#160;$91.6&#160;$93.7&#160;$100.2&#160;$97.1&#160;Retail services44.1&#160;45.8&#160;46.7&#160;50.5&#160;48.4&#160;Retail bankingMortgages(5)30.5&#160;32.3&#160;32.3&#160;33.4&#160;35.3&#160;Personal, small business and other2.8&#160;3.1&#160;3.5&#160;3.7&#160;3.9&#160;Global Wealth(3)(4)Cards3.8&#160;4.0&#160;4.0&#160;4.6&#160;4.4&#160;Mortgages(5)75.4&#160;77.8&#160;82.0&#160;84.0&#160;85.2&#160;Personal, small business and other(6)71.0&#160;67.0&#160;65.1&#160;60.6&#160;60.3&#160;Total$313.5&#160;$321.6&#160;$327.3&#160;$337.0&#160;$334.6&#160;Legacy FranchisesAsia Consumer(7)$19.5&#160;$17.3&#160;$13.4&#160;$13.3&#160;$10.0&#160;Mexico Consumer (excludes Mexico SBMM)13.6&#160;13.5&#160;13.7&#160;14.8&#160;16.3&#160;Legacy Holdings Assets(8)3.7&#160;3.2&#160;3.2&#160;3.0&#160;2.8&#160;Total$36.8&#160;$34.0&#160;$30.3&#160;$31.1&#160;$29.1&#160;Total consumer loans$350.3&#160;$355.6&#160;$357.6&#160;$368.1&#160;$363.7&#160;(1)End-of-period loans include interest and fees on credit cards.(2)Asia Consumer loan balances, reported within Legacy Franchises, exclude any loans reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) as of the date Citi enters into a sale agreement for the respective Asia Consumer banking business.

The remaining Asia Consumer loan portfolios&#8212;China, Korea, Russia and Poland&#8212;are held-for-investment and included in end-of-period consumer loans for all periods presented. All HFS portfolios were reclassified prior to the end of 1Q22 except for a $1.8 billion portfolio, which was moved to HFS in 1Q23.(3)Consists of $98.9 billion, $98.2 billion, $99.3 billion, $94.6 billion and $94.1 billion of loans in North America as of March&#160;31, 2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

Over 90% of these loans are fully collateralized (consisting primarily of marketable investment securities, commercial real estate and limited partner capital commitments in private equity) and have experienced very low historical NCLs. As discussed below, approximately 93% of the classifiably managed portion of these loans are investment grade. See &#8220;Consumer Loan Delinquencies Amounts and Ratios&#8221; below for details on the delinquency-managed portfolio.(7)Asia Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.(8)Primarily consists of certain North America consumer mortgages.For information on changes to Citi&#8217;s consumer loans, see &#8220;Liquidity Risk&#8212;Loans&#8221; below.40Consumer Credit TrendsPersonal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)Personal Banking and Wealth ManagementAs indicated above, PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth). U.S. Personal Banking provides card products through Branded cards and Retail services, and also includes mortgages and home equity, small business and personal consumer loans through Citi&#8217;s Retail banking network. The Retail bank is concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. Global Wealth provides investment services, cards, mortgages and personal, small business and other consumer loans through the Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. As of March 31, 2023, 43% of PBWM consumer loans consisted of Branded cards and Retail services card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of PBWM, as U.S. Cards net credit losses represented approximately 93% of total PBWM losses. As shown in the chart above, the first quarter of 2023 net credit loss rate in PBWM increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting ongoing normalization from historically low levels in U.S. Cards.PBWM&#8217;s 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, also driven by a continued increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization in U.S. Cards.Branded CardsU.S. Personal Banking&#8217;s Branded cards portfolio includes proprietary and co-branded cards. As shown in the chart above, the first quarter of 2023 net credit loss rate in Branded cards increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting ongoing normalization toward pre-pandemic levels from historically low levels (4Q&#8217;19 and 1Q&#8217;20 NCL ratios were 3.10% and 3.40%, respectively).The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over year, also driven by a continued increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization toward pre-pandemic levels (4Q&#8217;19 and 1Q&#8217;20 90+ DPD ratios were 0.95% and 1.01%, respectively). Retail ServicesU.S. Personal Banking&#8217;s Retail services partners directly with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded cards. Retail services&#8217; target market focuses on select industry segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail services continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and growth potential.As shown in the chart above, the first quarter of 2023 net credit loss rate in Retail services increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization toward pre-pandemic levels from historically low levels (for 4Q&#8217;19 and 1Q&#8217;20, the NCL ratios were 5.05% and 5.35%, respectively, and the 90+ DPD ratios were 1.91% and 1.96%, respectively).The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, also driven by a continued increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization.For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other information for Citi&#8217;s cards portfolios, see each respective business&#8217;s results of operations above and Note 13.41Retail BankingU.S. Personal Banking&#8217;s Retail banking portfolio consists primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first and second mortgages. For additional information, see &#8220;Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios&#8221; in Note 13.As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Retail banking for the first quarter of 2023 increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to a decrease in recoveries and normalization of losses in the personal loan portfolio, and decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of industry-wide episodic overdraft losses in the prior-year period.The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by U.S. mortgages, which reflected the lasting effects of government stimulus, unemployment benefits and consumer relief programs.Global WealthAs discussed above, the Global Wealth credit portfolio primarily consists of consumer mortgages, cards and other lending products extended to customer segments that range from the affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through the Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. These customer segments represent a target market that is characterized by historically low default rates and delinquencies. As of March 31, 2023, approximately $49 billion, or 33%, of the portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 93% is rated investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart above is calculated only for the delinquency-managed portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed portfolios.As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Global Wealth for the first quarter of 2023 decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter, due to a classifiably managed loan charge-off in the prior quarter, while the net credit loss rate year-over-year was broadly stable. The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, reflecting the strong credit profiles of the portfolios. The low levels of net credit losses and the 90+ days past due delinquency rate continued to reflect the strong credit profiles of the portfolios. Legacy FranchisesLegacy Franchises provides traditional retail banking and branded card products to retail and small business customers in Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer.Asia(1) Consumer (1)Asia Consumer includes Legacy Franchises activities in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Asia Consumer (for the remaining consumer banking portfolios held-for-investment (China, Korea, Russia and Poland)) for the first quarter of 2023 increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The increases were primarily driven by lower average loans due to the ongoing wind-downs of the remaining businesses, particularly Korea, and the reclassification of a portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 2023.The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, mainly driven by lower loans due to the ongoing wind-downs of the remaining businesses and the reclassification of a portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 2023. The overall performance of remaining Asia Consumer portfolios continues to reflect the strong credit profiles in the region&#8217;s target customer segments.42Mexico ConsumerMexico Consumer operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing multiproduct relationships with customers.As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer for the first quarter of 2023 increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by the gradual normalization of loss rates after peak losses experienced during the pandemic.The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was largely unchanged quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.For additional information on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other information for Citi&#8217;s consumer loan portfolios, see each respective business&#8217;s results of operations above and Note 13.U.S. Cards FICO DistributionThe following tables show the current FICO score distributions for Citi&#8217;s Branded cards and Retail services portfolios based on end-of-period receivables. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio and on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.Branded CardsFICO distribution(1)March 31, 2023December 31, 2022March 31, 2022 76045&#160;%48&#160;%48&#160;%680&#8211;76039&#160;38&#160;39&#160; 68016&#160;14&#160;13&#160;Total100&#160;%100&#160;%100&#160;%Retail ServicesFICO distribution(1)March 31, 2023December 31, 2022March 31, 2022 76026&#160;%27&#160;%27&#160;%680&#8211;76042&#160;42&#160;44&#160; 68032&#160;31&#160;29&#160;Total100&#160;%100&#160;%100&#160;%(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer presentations. The FICO distribution of both card portfolios trended down from the prior quarter and the prior year, reflecting the ongoing normalization in net credit loss and delinquency rates normalization in the portfolio. However, the FICO distribution continues to reflect strong underlying credit quality and a benefit from the continued impacts of government stimulus, unemployment benefits and customer relief programs.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $80 million ($0.6 billion), $89 million ($0.6&#160;billion) and $161&#160;million ($0.9&#160;billion) at March&#160;31, 2023, December&#160;31, 2022 and March&#160;31, 2022, respectively.

These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios. (6)These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and therefore delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of March&#160;31, 2023, December&#160;31, 2022 and March&#160;31, 2022, 93%, 96% and 92% of Global Wealth classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade.

Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications commenced as follows: Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22 (Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and Vietnam closed in 1Q23). In addition, a portfolio was reclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023.

The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $81 million ($0.3 billion), $90 million ($0.3&#160;billion) and $124 million ($0.4 billion) at March&#160;31, 2023, December&#160;31, 2022 and March&#160;31, 2022, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30&#8211;89&#160;days past due (the 30&#8211;89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $30 million, $37&#160;million and $35 million at March&#160;31, 2023, December&#160;31, 2022 and March&#160;31, 2022, respectively.

Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income.

Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.(2)Approximately 61%, 50%, 68%, 52% and 66% of Citi&#8217;s corporate non-accrual loans were performing at March&#160;31, 2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.(3)The March&#160;31, 2023 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.42% of total corporate loans.(4)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.Modified LoansOn January 1, 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs (see Note 1 for additional information).

For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi&#8217;s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Mexico, Korea, Singapore and India. The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup&#8217;s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of Citigroup&#8217;s consolidated Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other entities within Citigroup. Citigroup&#8217;s average HQLA increased quarter-over-quarter as of the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in customer-related debt at the non-bank entities. As of March&#160;31, 2023, Citigroup had approximately $1,033 billion of available liquidity resources to support client and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($588 billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within Citigroup ($252 billion); and unused borrowing capacity from available assets not already accounted for within Citi&#8217;s HQLA to support the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window ($193 billion).Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed for Citi&#8217;s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The table below details the components of Citi&#8217;s LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:In billions of dollarsMar. 31, 2023Dec. 31, 2022Mar. 31, 2022HQLA$584.3&#160;$575.2&#160;$540.2&#160;Net outflows488.2&#160;489.0&#160;466.2&#160;LCR120&#160;%118&#160;%116&#160;%HQLA in excess of net outflows$96.1&#160;$86.2&#160;$74.0&#160;Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.As of March&#160;31, 2023, Citigroup&#8217;s average LCR increased, from the quarter ended December&#160;31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in average HQLA, primarily driven by the increase in customer-related debt at the non-bank entities. In addition, considering Citi&#8217;s total available liquidity resources at quarter end of $1,033 billion, Citi maintained approximately $545 billion of excess liquidity above the stressed average net outflow of $488 billion, as noted in the table above for LCR.53Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a rule to assess the availability of a bank&#8217;s stable funding against a required level. The rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, while public disclosure of the ratio is required to occur on a semiannual basis beginning June 30, 2023. Citi was in compliance with the rule as of March&#160;31, 2023.Select Balance Sheet ItemsThis section provides details of select liquidity-related assets and liabilities reported on Citigroup&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet on an average and end-of-period basis.Cash and InvestmentsThe table below details average and end-of-period Cash and due from banks, Deposits with banks (collectively cash) and Investment securities. Citi&#8217;s investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and other sovereign bonds, with an aggregate duration of less than three years. At March 31, 2023, Citi&#8217;s cash and investment securities comprised approximately 34% of Citigroup&#8217;s total assets:In billions of dollars1Q234Q221Q22Cash and due from banks$28&#160;$30&#160;$32&#160;Deposits with banks326&#160;306&#160;261&#160;Investments516&#160;519&#160;519&#160;Total Citigroup cash and investments (AVG)$870&#160;$855&#160;$812&#160;Total Citigroup cash and investments (EOP)$837&#160;$869&#160;$787&#160;LoansThe table below details the average loans, by business and/or segment, and the total Citigroup end-of-period loans for each of the periods indicated:In billions of dollars1Q234Q221Q22Personal Banking and Wealth ManagementU.S. Retail banking$38&#160;$37&#160;$33&#160;U.S. Cards146&#160;143&#160;128&#160;Global Wealth149&#160;150&#160;151&#160;Total$333&#160;$330&#160;$312&#160;Institutional Clients GroupServices$79&#160;$79&#160;$81&#160;Banking191&#160;194&#160;194&#160;Markets13&#160;12&#160;14&#160;Total$283&#160;$285&#160;$289&#160;Total Legacy Franchises(1)$38&#160;$38&#160;$48&#160;Total Citigroup loans (AVG)$654&#160;$653&#160;$649&#160;Total Citigroup loans (EOP)$652&#160;$657&#160;$660&#160;(1)See footnote 2 to the table in &#8220;Credit Risk&#8212;Consumer Credit&#8212;Consumer Credit Portfolio&#8221; above.Citi&#8217;s loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans, with an aggregate duration of 1.3 years, as a majority of loans are at variable rates.On an average basis, loans increased 1% year-over-year and were largely unchanged sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to growth in PBWM, partially offset by a decline in ICG and lower balances in Legacy Franchises. PBWM average loans increased 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by loan growth in cards, mortgages and installment lending. ICG average loans decreased 2% year-over-year, driven by continued strategic actions to manage the balance sheet, including trade loan sales. The decline in Legacy Franchises primarily reflected the impact of the ongoing wind-downs of the remaining businesses, particularly Korea, and the reclassification of a portfolio to Other assets to reflect held-for-sale accounting in the current quarter. End-of-period loans decreased 1% year-over-year, as growth in PBWM was more than offset by a decline in ICG and Legacy Franchises. End-of-period loans declined 1% sequentially. DepositsThe table below details the average deposits, by business and/or segment, and the total Citigroup end-of-period deposits for each of the periods indicated:In billions of dollars1Q234Q221Q22Personal Banking and Wealth ManagementU.S. Personal Banking$111&#160;$111&#160;$118&#160;Global Wealth323&#160;320&#160;329&#160;Total$434&#160;$431&#160;$447&#160;Institutional Clients GroupTTS $704&#160;$694&#160;$670&#160;Securities services125&#160;129&#160;135&#160;Markets and Banking24&#160;25&#160;21&#160;Total$853&#160;$848&#160;$826&#160;Legacy Franchises(1)$50&#160;$50&#160;$55&#160;Corporate/Other$26&#160;$32&#160;$6&#160;Total Citigroup deposits (AVG)$1,363&#160;$1,361&#160;$1,334&#160;Total Citigroup deposits (EOP)$1,330&#160;$1,366&#160;$1,334&#160;(1)See footnote 2 to the table in &#8220;Credit Risk&#8212;Consumer Credit&#8212;Consumer Credit Portfolio&#8221; above.Citi&#8217;s deposit base is spread across a diversified set of countries, industries, clients and currencies. On an average basis, deposits increased 2% year-over-year and were up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected an increase in Corporate/Other and ICG, partially offset by a decline in PBWM and Legacy Franchises. Corporate/Other average deposits increased $20 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by the issuance of institutional certificates of deposit. ICG average deposits increased 3% year-over-year, driven by TTS. PBWM average deposits decreased 3% year-over-year, largely reflecting the Global Wealth reallocation of deposits to higher-yielding investments. The decline in Legacy Franchises was primarily 54due to the impact of the ongoing Korea and Russia wind-downs.End-of-period deposits were largely unchanged year-over-year, as a decrease in PBWM, largely reflecting Global Wealth clients reallocating deposits to higher-yielding investments on the business&#8217;s platform, was offset by an increase in institutional certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other. End-of-period deposits decreased 3% sequentially, reflecting seasonal activity in TTS and the reallocation of Global Wealth clients&#8217; deposits to higher-yielding investments. On a sequential basis, end-of-period deposits were down $36 billion, primarily driven by ICG, largely reflecting seasonal client activity.The majority of Citi&#8217;s $1.3 trillion of end-of-period deposits are institutional (approximately $819 billion), and span 90 countries. A large majority of these institutional deposits are within TTS, and of these, approximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly 80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a greater than 15-year relationship with Citi. Over the past year, TTS deposits grew at a faster rate than total Citi deposits on both an average and end-of-period basis. Citi also has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, with $437 billion of U.S. Retail banking and Global Wealth deposits as of end-of-period, which are diversified across the Private bank, Citigold, Retail banking and Wealth at Work. As of year-end 2022, approximately 75% of U.S. Citigold clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years and approximately 50% of Private bank ultra-high-net-worth clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years. U.S. Personal Banking deposits are spread across six core urban centers.Long-Term Debt The weighted-average maturity of unsecured long-term debt issued by Citigroup and its affiliates (including Citibank) with a remaining life greater than one year was approximately 7.5&#160;years as of March&#160;31, 2023, compared to 8.5 years as of the prior year and 7.6 years as of the prior quarter. The weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, the weighted-average maturity is calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable.Citi&#8217;s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as well as non-structured notes. Citi&#8217;s issuance of customer-related debt is generally driven by customer demand and complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding for Citi&#8217;s non-bank entities. Citi&#8217;s long-term debt at the bank includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations. Long-Term Debt OutstandingThe following table presents Citi&#8217;s end-of-period total long-term debt outstanding for each of the dates indicated:In billions of dollarsMar. 31, 2023Dec. 31, 2022Mar. 31, 2022Non-bank(1)Benchmark debt:Senior debt$117.1&#160;$117.5&#160;$122.2&#160;Subordinated debt22.7&#160;22.5&#160;24.7&#160;Trust preferred1.6&#160;1.6&#160;1.6&#160;Customer-related debt109.7&#160;101.1&#160;78.4&#160;Local country and other(2)8.7&#160;7.8&#160;7.8&#160;Total non-bank$259.8&#160;$250.5&#160;$234.7&#160;BankFHLB borrowings$7.3&#160;$7.3&#160;$1.0&#160;Securitizations(3)6.6&#160;7.6&#160;9.5&#160;Citibank benchmark senior debt2.6&#160;2.6&#160;3.5&#160;Local country and other(2)3.4&#160;3.6&#160;5.3&#160;Total bank$19.9&#160;$21.1&#160;$19.3&#160;Total long-term debt$279.7&#160;$271.6&#160;$254.0&#160;Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums.(1)Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent holding company (Citigroup) and Citi&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries (including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of March&#160;31, 2023, non-bank included $92.9 billion of long-term debt issued by Citi&#8217;s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are also included in this line.(2)Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi&#8217;s affiliates in support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured financing is also included.(3)Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded cards receivables.Citi&#8217;s total long-term debt outstanding increased 10% year-over-year, largely driven by the issuance of customer-related debt at the non-bank entities and increased FHLB borrowings at the bank. The increase was partially offset by a decline in senior benchmark debt at both the bank and non-bank entities, as well as lower securitizations at the bank. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding increased 3%, largely driven by the issuance of customer-related debt at the non-bank entities. As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi&#8217;s overall funding costs. During the first quarter of 2023, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of approximately $4.8 billion of its outstanding long-term debt. 55Long-Term Debt Issuances and MaturitiesThe table below details Citi&#8217;s long-term debt issuances and maturities (including repurchases and redemptions) during the periods presented:&#160;1Q234Q221Q22In billions of dollarsMaturitiesIssuancesMaturitiesIssuancesMaturitiesIssuancesNon-bankBenchmark debt:Senior debt$1.7&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$0.1&#160;$2.8&#160;$4.4&#160;$13.8&#160;Subordinated debt&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Trust preferred &#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;0.1&#160;&#8212;&#160;Customer-related debt9.0&#160;14.1&#160;6.9&#160;14.3&#160;7.5&#160;14.5&#160;Local country and other0.4&#160;1.5&#160;0.9&#160;1.4&#160;0.4&#160;0.9&#160;Total non-bank$11.1&#160;$15.6&#160;$7.9&#160;$18.5&#160;$12.4&#160;$29.2&#160;BankFHLB borrowings$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$4.3&#160;$&#8212;&#160;Securitizations1.0&#160;&#8212;&#160;1.0&#160;0.2&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Citibank benchmark senior debt&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Local country and other0.3&#160;0.1&#160;1.2&#160;0.6&#160;0.4&#160;0.5&#160;Total bank$1.3&#160;$0.1&#160;$2.2&#160;$0.8&#160;$4.7&#160;$0.5&#160;Total$12.4&#160;$15.7&#160;$10.1&#160;$19.3&#160;$17.1&#160;$29.7&#160;The table below shows Citi&#8217;s aggregate long-term debt maturities (including repurchases and redemptions) during the first quarter of 2023, as well as its aggregate expected remaining long-term debt maturities by year as of March&#160;31, 2023:&#160;1Q23MaturitiesIn billions of dollars202320242025202620272028ThereafterTotalNon-bankBenchmark debt:Senior debt$1.7&#160;$3.3&#160;$10.6&#160;$11.9&#160;$23.7&#160;$7.0&#160;$14.9&#160;$45.7&#160;$117.1&#160;Subordinated debt&#8212;&#160;1.2&#160;0.9&#160;4.8&#160;2.3&#160;3.7&#160;2.0&#160;7.8&#160;22.7&#160;Trust preferred &#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;1.6&#160;1.6&#160;Customer-related debt9.0&#160;13.1&#160;22.5&#160;14.9&#160;7.9&#160;9.9&#160;5.8&#160;35.6&#160;109.7&#160;Local country and other0.4&#160;1.5&#160;0.9&#160;1.8&#160;0.7&#160;&#8212;&#160;0.9&#160;2.9&#160;8.7&#160;Total non-bank$11.1&#160;$19.1&#160;$34.9&#160;$33.4&#160;$34.6&#160;$20.6&#160;$23.6&#160;$93.6&#160;$259.8&#160;BankFHLB borrowings$&#8212;&#160;$4.3&#160;$3.0&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$7.3&#160;Securitizations1.0&#160;1.2&#160;1.3&#160;1.6&#160;&#8212;&#160;0.8&#160;1.0&#160;0.7&#160;6.6&#160;Citibank benchmark senior debt&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;2.6&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;2.6&#160;Local country and other0.3&#160;0.5&#160;1.0&#160;0.2&#160;0.2&#160;&#8212;&#160;0.3&#160;1.2&#160;3.4&#160;Total bank$1.3&#160;$6.0&#160;$7.9&#160;$1.8&#160;$0.2&#160;$0.8&#160;$1.3&#160;$1.9&#160;$19.9&#160;Total long-term debt$12.4&#160;$25.1&#160;$42.8&#160;$35.2&#160;$34.8&#160;$21.4&#160;$24.9&#160;$95.5&#160;$279.7&#160; 56Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term BorrowingsCiti supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. Secured Funding TransactionsSecured funding is primarily accessed through Citi&#8217;s broker-dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through Citi&#8217;s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of Citi&#8217;s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral type, counterparty and client actions. Secured funding of $258 billion as of March&#160;31, 2023 increased 26% year-over-year and 27% sequentially, largely driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-related assets within Citi&#8217;s broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of the quarter ended March&#160;31, 2023, on an average basis, secured funding was $224 billion. The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as &#8220;matched book&#8221; activity and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other &#8220;matched book&#8221; activity is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities.Short-Term BorrowingsCiti&#8217;s short-term borrowings of $40 billion as of the first quarter of 2023 increased 33% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in FHLB advances and commercial paper issuance. Short-term borrowings decreased 15% sequentially, reflecting a decline in outstanding FHLB advances (see Note 17 for further information on Citigroup&#8217;s and its affiliates&#8217; outstanding short-term borrowings).57Credit RatingsThe table below shows the ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of March 31, 2023. While not included in the table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch, A2/P-1 at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A/A-1 at SP Global Ratings as of March&#160;31, 2023.Ratings as of March&#160;31, 2023Citigroup&#160;Inc.Citibank, N.A.&#160;Long-termShort-termOutlookLong-termShort-termOutlookFitch Ratings (Fitch)AF1StableA+F1StableMoody&#8217;s Investors Service (Moody&#8217;s)A3P-2StableAa3P-1StableSP Global Ratings (SP)BBB+A-2StableA+A-1StablePotential Impacts of Ratings DowngradesRatings downgrades by Fitch, Moody&#8217;s or SP could negatively impact Citigroup&#8217;s and/or Citibank&#8217;s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements.For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Liquidity Risks&#8221; and &#8220;Credit Ratings&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.Citigroup&#160;Inc. and Citibank&#8212;Potential Derivative TriggersAs of March&#160;31, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could impact Citigroup&#8217;s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.3 billion, compared to $0.5 billion as of December&#160;31, 2022. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.As of March&#160;31, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact Citibank&#8217;s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.3 billion, compared to $0.4 billion as of December&#160;31, 2022. Other funding sources, such as secured funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely impacted.In total, as of March&#160;31, 2023, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.6 billion, compared to $0.9 billion as of December&#160;31, 2022 (see also Note&#160;20). As detailed under &#8220;High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)&#8221; above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above.Citibank&#8212;Additional Potential ImpactsIn addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank&#8217;s senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of March&#160;31, 2023, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $10.9 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, compared to $11.0 billion as of December&#160;31, 2022 (see Note 19 for additional information).In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.58MARKET RISKMarket risk arises from both Citi&#8217;s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on market risk and market risk management at Citi, see &#8220;Market Risk&#8212;Overview&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.Market Risk of Non-Trading PortfoliosMarket risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi&#8217;s net interest income and on Citi&#8217;s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi&#8217;s capital invested in foreign currencies.Banking Book Interest Rate Risk For interest rate risk purposes, Citi&#8217;s non-trading portfolios are referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi&#8217;s Non-Trading Market Risk Policy. Management&#8217;s Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi&#8217;s risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are subject to approval by Citigroup&#8217;s Board of Directors. Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day management of Citi&#8217;s Banking Book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi&#8217;s Banking Book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.Changes in interest rates impact Citi&#8217;s net income, AOCI and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi&#8217;s Banking Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk factors, including:&#8226;Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments;&#8226;Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;&#8226;Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates (e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and&#8226;Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment.As part of their ongoing activities, Citi&#8217;s businesses generate interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi&#8217;s funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target Citi&#8217;s desired risk profile, including its investment securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate derivatives. In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on Citi&#8217;s Banking Book net interest income and certain other interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not represent a forecast of Citi&#8217;s net interest income.The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment, changes in Citi&#8217;s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi&#8217;s modeling and other factors.Since the third quarter of 2022, Citi has employed enhanced IRE methodologies and changes to certain assumptions. The changes included, among other things, assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions (notably accrual positions in ICG&#8217;s Markets businesses). These changes resulted in a higher impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest income over a 12-month period.Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas), are informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts.Citi&#8217;s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client deposits, Citi&#8217;s deposits with other banks, investment securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio VAR.59 Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios&#8212;Impact on AOCICiti also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi&#8217;s common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact Citi&#8217;s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and regulatory capital position.AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi&#8217;s capital generation capacity. Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current market implied forward rates. The following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates:In millions of dollars, except as otherwise notedMar. 31, 2023Dec. 31, 2022Mar. 31, 2022Parallel interest rate shock +100 bpsInterest rate exposure(1)(2)U.S. dollar$304&#160;$186&#160;$631&#160;All other currencies1,361&#160;1,650&#160;2,293&#160;Total$1,665&#160;$1,836&#160;$2,924&#160;As a percentage of average interest-earning assets0.07&#160;%0.08&#160;%0.14&#160;%Estimated initial negative impact to AOCI (after-tax)(3)$(1,557)$(1,102)$(3,439)Estimated initial impact on CET1 Capital ratio (bps) from AOCI scenario(11)(10)(18)(1)Excludes trading book and fair value option banking book portfolios and replaces them with the associated transfer pricing.(2)IRE as of March 31, 2022 does not reflect certain IRE methodology enhancements that were subsequently implemented in September 2022, most notably the Banking Book revisions to the treatment of certain business activities.(3)Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.Citi&#8217;s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of the first quarter of 2023 decreased modestly quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing Citi&#8217;s IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi&#8217;s estimated IRE.In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that the approximate $1.6 billion initial negative impact to AOCI could potentially be offset in shareholders&#8217; equity through the expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of Citi&#8217;s investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately six months.60Scenario AnalysisThe following table presents the estimated impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest income, AOCI and CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) under five different scenarios of changes in interest rate for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of March 31, 2023. The rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products.In millions of dollars, except as otherwise notedScenario 1Scenario 2Scenario 3Scenario 4Scenario 5Overnight rate change (bps)100&#160;100&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;(100)10-year rate change (bps)100&#160;&#8212;&#160;100&#160;(100)(100)Interest rate exposureU.S. dollar$304&#160;$209&#160;$96&#160;$(128)$(520)All other currencies1,361&#160;1,161&#160;207&#160;(199)(1,252)Total$1,665&#160;$1,370&#160;$303&#160;$(327)$(1,772)Estimated initial impact to AOCI (after-tax)(1)$(1,557)$(1,223)$(353)$265&#160;$1,504&#160;Estimated initial impact to CET1 Capital ratio (bps) from AOCI scenario(11)(8)(3)3&#160;11&#160;Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. (1)Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.As shown in the table above, the estimated impact to Citi&#8217;s net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than Scenario 3, as Citi&#8217;s Banking Book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For U.S. dollars, exposure to downward parallel rate shocks is larger in magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from Citi&#8217;s deposit base at higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. For other currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude as a result of Citi&#8217;s flooring assumption, given low rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar currencies.The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because the combination of changes to Citi&#8217;s investment portfolio, partially offset by changes related to Citi&#8217;s pension liabilities, results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.61Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates&#8212;Impacts on AOCI and CapitalAs of March&#160;31, 2023, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi&#8217;s tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.6 billion, or 0.91%, as a result of changes to Citi&#8217;s CTA in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, Euro and Indian rupee.This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi&#8217;s net investments in foreign currency-denominated capital, these movements also change the value of Citi&#8217;s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. This, coupled with Citi&#8217;s foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi&#8217;s CET1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi&#8217;s capital compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.The effect of Citi&#8217;s ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the quarterly impact of these changes on Citi&#8217;s TCE and CET1 Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. See Note 18 for additional information on the changes in AOCI.For the quarter endedIn millions of dollars, except as otherwise notedMar. 31, 2023Dec. 31, 2022Mar. 31, 2022Change in FX spot rate(1)1.5&#160;%4.0&#160;%0.1&#160;%Change in TCE due to FX translation, net of hedges$636&#160;$1,193&#160;$(40)As a percentage of TCE0.4&#160;%0.8&#160;%&#8212;&#160;%Estimated impact to CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) due to changes in FX translation, net of hedges (bps)1&#160;(3)1&#160;(1) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;FX spot rate change is a weighted average based on Citi&#8217;s quarterly average GAAP capital exposure to foreign countries.62This page intentionally left blank.63 Interest Revenue/Expense and Net Interest Margin (NIM)1st Qtr.4th Qtr.1st Qtr.ChangeIn millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted2023&#160;2022&#160;20221Q23 vs. 1Q22Interest revenue(1)$29,439&#160;&#160;$25,741&#160;&#160;$13,193&#160;123&#160;%Interest expense(2) 16,047&#160;&#160;12,438&#160;&#160;2,280&#160;604&#160;Net interest income, taxable equivalent basis(1)$13,392&#160;&#160;$13,303&#160;&#160;$10,913&#160;23&#160;%Interest revenue&#8212;average rate(3)5.30&#160;%4.62&#160;%2.47&#160;%283&#160;bpsInterest expense&#8212;average rate3.59&#160;2.77&#160;0.54&#160;305&#160;bpsNet interest margin(3)(4) 2.41&#160;2.39&#160;2.05&#160;36&#160;bpsInterest rate benchmarks&#160;&#160;Two-year&#160;U.S.&#160;Treasury&#160;note&#8212;average&#160;rate4.34&#160;%4.39&#160;%1.46&#160;%288&#160;bps10-year U.S. Treasury note&#8212;average rate3.65&#160;&#160;3.83&#160;&#160;1.95&#160;170&#160;bps10-year vs. two-year spread(69)bps(56)bps49&#160;bps&#160;&#160;(1)Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $44 million, $33 million and $42 million for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023, December&#160;31, 2022 and March&#160;31, 2022, respectively.

As presented in the table above, Citi&#8217;s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis also increased 23% year-over-year, or $2.5 billion. The increase was driven by higher net interest income in non-ICG Markets, which increased 21%, and ICG Markets, which increased 34%. The increase in net interest income in non-ICG Markets primarily reflected higher interest rates, growth in U.S. Cards interest-earning balances and higher income from Citi&#8217;s investment portfolio, partially offset by the impact of the closed exit markets and wind-downs in Legacy Franchises. The increase in ICG Markets net interest income largely reflected a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity.Citi&#8217;s net interest margin was 2.41% on a taxable equivalent basis in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 2 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the impact of higher interest rates and growth in U.S. Cards interest-earning balances, partially offset by lower deposit spreads in Services. 65Additional Interest Rate DetailsAverage Balances and Interest Rates&#8212;Assets(1)(2)(3)Taxable Equivalent BasisQuarterly&#8212;AssetsAverage balanceInterest revenue% Average rate1st Qtr.4th Qtr.1st Qtr.1st Qtr.4th Qtr.1st Qtr.1st Qtr.4th Qtr.1st Qtr.In millions of dollars, except rates202320222022202320222022202320222022Deposits with banks(4)$328,141&#160;$305,658&#160;$260,536&#160;$3,031&#160;$2,343&#160;$296&#160;3.75&#160;%3.04&#160;%0.46&#160;%Securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell(5)In U.S. offices$186,573&#160;$185,678&#160;$177,996&#160;$2,840&#160;$2,081&#160;$109&#160;6.17&#160;%4.45&#160;%0.25&#160;%In offices outside the U.S.(4)181,476&#160;172,835&#160;165,640&#160;2,334&#160;1,698&#160;285&#160;5.22&#160;3.90&#160;0.70&#160;Total$368,049&#160;$358,513&#160;$343,636&#160;$5,174&#160;$3,779&#160;$394&#160;5.70&#160;%4.18&#160;%0.46&#160;%Trading account assets(6)(7)In U.S. offices$164,217&#160;$149,536&#160;$136,857&#160;$1,773&#160;$1,585&#160;$592&#160;4.38&#160;%4.21&#160;%1.75&#160;%In offices outside the U.S.(4)134,607&#160;127,838&#160;133,603&#160;975&#160;1,041&#160;556&#160;2.94&#160;3.23&#160;1.69&#160;Total$298,824&#160;$277,374&#160;$270,460&#160;$2,748&#160;$2,626&#160;$1,148&#160;3.73&#160;%3.76&#160;%1.72&#160;%InvestmentsIn U.S. officesTaxable$344,776&#160;$353,602&#160;$353,906&#160;$2,149&#160;$1,968&#160;$1,021&#160;2.53&#160;%2.21&#160;%1.17&#160;%Exempt from U.S. income tax11,608&#160;11,648&#160;11,612&#160;116&#160;111&#160;95&#160;4.05&#160;3.78&#160;3.32&#160;In offices outside the U.S.(4)160,140&#160;153,822&#160;153,302&#160;1,894&#160;1,733&#160;951&#160;4.80&#160;4.47&#160;2.52&#160;Total$516,524&#160;$519,072&#160;$518,820&#160;$4,159&#160;$3,812&#160;$2,067&#160;3.27&#160;%2.91&#160;%1.62&#160;%Consumer loans(8)In U.S. offices$283,493&#160;$280,818&#160;$257,257&#160;$7,051&#160;$6,670&#160;$5,045&#160;10.09&#160;%9.42&#160;%7.95&#160;%In offices outside the U.S.(4)80,176&#160;79,700&#160;94,973&#160;1,573&#160;1,478&#160;1,217&#160;7.96&#160;7.36&#160;5.20&#160;Total$363,669&#160;$360,518&#160;$352,230&#160;$8,624&#160;$8,148&#160;$6,262&#160;9.62&#160;%8.97&#160;%7.21&#160;%Corporate loans(8)In U.S. offices$137,733&#160;$139,031&#160;$136,876&#160;$1,736&#160;$1,571&#160;$1,112&#160;5.11&#160;%4.48&#160;%3.29&#160;%In offices outside the U.S.(4)152,335&#160;152,953&#160;159,470&#160;2,951&#160;2,550&#160;1,365&#160;7.86&#160;6.61&#160;3.47&#160;Total$290,068&#160;$291,984&#160;$296,346&#160;$4,687&#160;$4,121&#160;$2,477&#160;6.55&#160;%5.60&#160;%3.39&#160;%Total loans(8)In U.S. offices$421,226&#160;$419,849&#160;$394,133&#160;$8,787&#160;$8,241&#160;$6,157&#160;8.46&#160;%7.79&#160;%6.34&#160;%In offices outside the U.S.(4)232,511&#160;232,653&#160;254,443&#160;4,524&#160;4,028&#160;2,582&#160;7.89&#160;6.87&#160;4.12&#160;Total$653,737&#160;$652,502&#160;$648,576&#160;$13,311&#160;$12,269&#160;$8,739&#160;8.26&#160;%7.46&#160;%5.46&#160;%Other interest-earning assets(9)$87,758&#160;$98,131&#160;$119,815&#160;$1,016&#160;$912&#160;$549&#160;4.70&#160;%3.69&#160;%1.86&#160;%Total interest-earning assets$2,253,033&#160;$2,211,250&#160;$2,161,843&#160;$29,439&#160;$25,741&#160;$13,193&#160;5.30&#160;%4.62&#160;%2.47&#160;%Non-interest-earning&#160;assets(6)$209,211&#160;$219,302&#160;$212,197&#160;Total assets$2,462,244&#160;$2,430,552&#160;$2,374,040&#160;(1)Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $44 million, $33 million and $42 million for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023, December&#160;31, 2022 and March&#160;31, 2022, respectively.(2)Interest rates and amounts include the effects of risk management activities associated with the respective asset categories.(3)Monthly or quarterly averages have been used by certain subsidiaries where daily averages are unavailable.(4)Average rates reflect prevailing local interest rates, including inflationary effects and monetary corrections in certain countries.(5)Average volumes of securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell are reported net pursuant to ASC&#160;210-20-45.

As of March&#160;31, 2023, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 65% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of December&#160;31, 2022, the add-on was 46%.As presented in the table below, Citi&#8217;s average trading VAR for the first quarter of 2023 decreased modestly quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to lower market volatility earlier in the current quarter. As of March 31, 2023, VAR included updates to the market historical data series to reflect increased March volatility in the rates markets.Quarter-end and Average Trading VAR and Trading and Credit Portfolio VARFirst QuarterFourth QuarterFirst QuarterIn millions of dollarsMarch 31, 20232023 AverageDecember 31, 20222022 AverageMarch 31, 20222022 AverageInterest rate$172&#160;$131&#160;$130&#160;$133&#160;$84&#160;$57&#160;Credit spread80&#160;76&#160;78&#160;82&#160;70&#160;66&#160;Covariance adjustment(1)(55)(52)(45)(58)(51)(32)Fully diversified interest rate and credit spread(2)$197&#160;$155&#160;$163&#160;$157&#160;$103&#160;$91&#160;Foreign exchange15&#160;19&#160;20&#160;25&#160;35&#160;36&#160;Equity22&#160;24&#160;27&#160;26&#160;29&#160;30&#160;Commodity43&#160;36&#160;32&#160;41&#160;65&#160;42&#160;Covariance adjustment(1)(94)(93)(94)(105)(116)(100)Total trading VAR&#8212;all market risk factors, including general and specific risk (excluding credit portfolios)(2)$183&#160;$141&#160;$148&#160;$144&#160;$116&#160;$99&#160;Specific risk-only component(3)$(4)$(6)$(4)$(6)$&#8212;&#160;$6&#160;Total trading VAR&#8212;general market risk factors only (excluding credit portfolios)$187&#160;$147&#160;$152&#160;$150&#160;$116&#160;$93&#160;Incremental impact of the credit portfolio(4)$8&#160;$20&#160;$30&#160;$40&#160;$29&#160;$38&#160;Total trading and credit portfolio VAR$191&#160;$161&#160;$178&#160;$184&#160;$145&#160;$137&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all CVA exposures.

Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in reserves.Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi&#8217;s VAR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions.As of March&#160;31, 2023, there were two back-testing exceptions observed for Citi&#8217;s Regulatory VAR in the last 12 months.

The synthetic USD LIBOR rates are expected to cease on September 30, 2024. The publication of synthetic USD LIBOR would provide additional time for certain USD LIBOR contracts to be remediated or mature.During April 2023, certain central counterparties (CCPs) completed conversions of certain USD LIBOR-cleared derivatives to alternative reference rate positions, with the remaining cleared derivative conversions expected to be completed in May 2023. In addition, on February 27, 2023, Citi provided notice that, after the June 30, 2023 cessation date, the relevant USD LIBOR rate for certain debt securities, certificates of deposit, preferred stock, asset-backed securities and trust preferred securities issued by Citigroup Inc. and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries is planned to be replaced with the CME Term SOFR Reference Rate published for the one-, three- or six-month tenor corresponding to the relevant USD LIBOR rate as administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration, Ltd., plus a tenor spread adjustment. For additional information about Citi&#8217;s actions to address a transition away from and discontinuance of LIBOR, see &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Other Risks&#8212;LIBOR Transition Risk&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. For information about Citi&#8217;s LIBOR transition risks, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Other Risks&#8221; in the 2022 Form 10-K.71Country RiskTop 25 Country ExposuresThe following table presents Citi&#8217;s top 25 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March&#160;31, 2023. (Including the U.S., the total exposure as of March&#160;31, 2023 to the top 25 countries would represent approximately 98% of Citi&#8217;s exposure to all countries.)For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As an example, with respect to the U.K., only 39% of corporate loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled entities (40% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties.

For additional information, see &#8220;Legacy Franchises&#8221; above and Note 2.Russia IntroductionIn Russia, Citi&#8217;s remaining operations are conducted through both its ICG and Legacy Franchises segments. As part of previously disclosed plans, Citi has ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia as of March 31, 2023, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In addition, Citi continues to wind down its consumer and local commercial banking businesses. Citi has ceased soliciting any new business or new clients in Russia. Citi will continue to manage its existing legal and regulatory commitments and obligations, as well as support its employees, during this period. For additional information, see &#8220;Citi&#8217;s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations&#8221; below.Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate.

(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Net MTM on OTC derivatives and securities lending/borrowing transactions (repos). Effective from 2Q22, reverse repurchase agreements have been shown gross of collateral and reclassified to net MTM on derivatives/repos in the table above, as netting of collateral for Russia-related reverse repurchase agreements was removed. This removal was due to the inability to conclude, with a well-founded basis, the enforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal system in the event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. As this exposure was already included in Total third-party exposure, the Total Russia exposure was not impacted by this reclassification.(3)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. (4)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia.(5)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the Depository. Citi is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government.(6)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The majority of AO Citibank&#8217;s third-party exposures was funded with the dividends under footnote 5 and domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and personal banking clients.(7)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Citigroup&#8217;s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup&#8217;s earnings only upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately described these risks in &#8220;Deconsolidation Risk&#8221; below.73During the first quarter of 2023, Citi continued to reduce its operations in Russia and Russia-related exposures, resulting in a net decrease in total Russia exposure of $1.4 billion, as shown in the table above, as well as a change in the composition of its exposure as mitigation efforts have reduced Citi&#8217;s third-party credit risk (see discussion below). The sequential decline in exposure was driven by (i) a $0.5 billion decrease due to depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, (ii) decreases in local currency terms of a $1.3 billion reduction in deposits held within the Central Bank of Russia driven by client deposit withdrawals, (iii) a $0.2 billion decrease due to loan repayments and sales, (iv) a $0.3 billion reduction in reverse repo balances and (v) a $0.1 billion reduction of third-party cross-border exposures. The decline in exposure was partially offset by an increase of $1.0 billion in exposure in local currency terms, driven by $1.3 billion of dividends received by Citi as custodian for investor clients in Russia that Citi was unable to remit due to regulatory restrictions, partially offset by payments to clients and tax authorities. The decline in overall exposure was also driven by a modest reduction in exposures to Russian counterparties not held by AO Citibank.Citi&#8217;s continued risk mitigation efforts have included ICG borrower paydowns and limiting extensions of new credit. ICG&#8217;s credit exposure also reflected a shift to a higher proportion of stronger credit names, including a higher proportion of subsidiaries of multinational companies that are headquartered outside of Russia, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Citi&#8217;s net investment in Russia was approximately $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2023 (unchanged from December 31, 2022). Citi hedges its ruble/USD spot FX exposure in AOCI through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in AOCI. When the ruble depreciates against the USD, the USD equivalent value of Citigroup&#8217;s investment in AO Citibank also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposures. Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi&#8217;s BusinessesCiti&#8217;s ICG, PBWM and Legacy Franchises segments and Corporate/Other have been impacted by various macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and its direct and indirect impact on the European and global economies. For a broader discussion of these factors and volatilities on Citi&#8217;s businesses, see &#8220;Executive Summary&#8221; and each business&#8217;s results of operations above. As of March 31, 2023, Citigroup&#8217;s ACL included a $0.2 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi&#8217;s direct and indirect Russian counterparties (compared to $0.3 billion at December 31, 2022).Citi&#8217;s Wind-Down of Its Russia OperationsIn August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In connection with this wind-down, Citi expects to incur approximately $210 million in total estimated charges ($60 million in ICG and $150 million in Legacy Franchises, excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), largely driven by restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. Citi&#8217;s referral agreement with a Russian bank for a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject to customer consents, can be terminated under certain circumstances and is being reevaluated as Citi reviews other alternatives. As a result, the credit card loans will remain held-for-investment and are not transferred to held-for-sale. For additional information about Citi&#8217;s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see Note 2 and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Other Risks&#8212;Country Risk&#8212;Russia&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.Deconsolidation RiskCiti&#8217;s remaining operations in Russia subject it to various risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation events (for additional information, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Other Risks&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior management. As of March 31, 2023, Citi continued to consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were triggered.In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for example, through expropriation of AO Citibank Russia, Citi&#8217;s foreign entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off the net investment of approximately $1.2 billion (unchanged from December 31, 2022), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of approximately $1.4 billion (compared to $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022) through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of $0.4 billion (compared to $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2022) on intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.4 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve.Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related ClientsCiti serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. Citi&#8217;s role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., 74Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally does not have information about the identity of the bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, procedures and controls for client relationships and payment processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and other jurisdictions&#8217; sanctions laws.These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law.Reputational RisksCiti has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, regulators and the public. Citi&#8217;s response to the war in Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative impact on Citi&#8217;s reputation with some or all of these parties.For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its current presence in Russia and association with Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or not, including Citi&#8217;s inability to support its global clients in Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses; current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived misalignment of Citi&#8217;s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; and the reputational impact from Citi&#8217;s activity and engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting their Russia businesses. Citi has considered the potential for reputation risk and taken actions to mitigate such risks. Citi established a Russia Special Review Process with management&#8217;s Reputation Risk Committee with oversight for significant Russia-related reputation risks and completed a number of reputation risk reviews of matters with a Russian nexus.While Citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those operations during the wind-down process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi&#8217;s reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country, cessation of new business and client originations, and reduction of other exposures.Citi&#8217;s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations. For additional information on operational and cyber risks, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Operational Risk&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.Board&#8217;s Role in Overseeing Related RisksThe Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board&#8217;s Risk Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees have received and continue to receive regular reports from senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its impact on Citi&#8217;s operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, as well as the war&#8217;s broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and reputational impacts. In addition to receiving regular briefings from management, the full Board has routinely been invited to attend portions of the RMC meetings for discussions related to the war in Ukraine, including with respect to Citi&#8217;s risk exposures and stress testing. The reports to the Board and its Committees from senior management who represent the impacted businesses and the EMEA region, Independent Risk Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk Management, including those individuals responsible for sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior management has also provided updates to Citi&#8217;s Executive Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, regarding Citi&#8217;s Russia-related risks, including with respect to cybersecurity matters.UkraineCiti has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war through its ICG businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs approximately 230 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi&#8217;s top priority. All of Citi&#8217;s domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. Citi&#8217;s exposures in Ukraine are not significant enough to be included in the &#8220;Top 25 Country Exposures&#8221; table above. As of March 31, 2023, Citi had $1.2 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine, compared to $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in exposures reflected a $0.3 billion increase in deposits, partially offset by a $0.1 billion decrease in loans. 75ArgentinaCiti operates in Argentina through its ICG businesses. As of March&#160;31, 2023, Citi&#8217;s net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.8 billion. Under U.S. GAAP, Citi uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its operations in countries such as Argentina that are deemed highly inflationary. Citi uses Argentina&#8217;s official market exchange rate to remeasure its net Argentine peso-denominated assets into the U.S. dollar. As of March&#160;31, 2023, the official Argentine peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was 208.995.As previously disclosed, the Central Bank of Argentina has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict Citi&#8217;s ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. As a result, Citi&#8217;s net investment in its Argentine operations is likely to continue to increase as Citi generates net income in its Argentine franchise and its earnings cannot be remitted.Due to the currency controls implemented by the Central Bank of Argentina, certain indirect foreign exchange mechanisms have developed that some Argentine entities may use to obtain U.S. dollars, generally at rates that are significantly higher than Argentina&#8217;s official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms, and these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure Citi&#8217;s net monetary assets into the U.S. dollar under U.S. GAAP. However, if Argentina&#8217;s official exchange rate converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur a significant loss on its capital in Argentina. Current macroeconomic conditions in the country, along with sustained high inflation and low international reserves held by the Central Bank of Argentina, may result in an accelerated or steep depreciation of the official exchange rate in the near term. Citi cannot predict future fluctuations in Argentina&#8217;s official market exchange rate or to what extent Citi may be able to access U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate in the future.Citi may economically hedge the foreign currency risk in its net Argentine peso-denominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. As of March&#160;31, 2023, the international NDF market had very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi&#8217;s inability to economically hedge substantially all of its Argentine peso exposure. Accordingly, and to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record devaluations on its net Argentine peso&#8208;denominated assets in earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure.Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records mark-to-market adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes it has established appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks under U.S. GAAP as of March&#160;31, 2023. However, U.S. regulatory agencies may require Citi to record additional reserves in the future, increasing ICG&#8217;s cost of credit, based on the perceived country or transfer risk associated with its Argentine exposures.For additional information on Citi&#8217;s emerging markets risks, including those related to its Argentine exposures, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Strategic Risks&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.76SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATESThis section contains a summary of Citi&#8217;s most significant accounting policies. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K contains a summary of all of Citigroup&#8217;s significant accounting policies. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Operational Risks&#8221; in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.Valuations of Financial InstrumentsCitigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. A substantial portion of these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet as Trading account assets, Available-for-sale securities and Trading account liabilities.Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private equity investing.When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance of inputs or value drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair value of these instruments is reported on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet with the changes in fair value recognized in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI.Losses on available-for-sale securities whose fair values are less than the amortized cost, where Citi intends to sell the security or could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security prior to recovery, are recognized in earnings. Where Citi does not intend to sell the security nor could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security, any portion of the loss that is attributable to credit is recognized as an allowance for credit losses with a corresponding provision for credit losses and the remainder of the loss is recognized in AOCI. Such losses are capped at the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the security.For equity securities carried at cost or under the measurement alternative, decreases in fair value below the carrying value are recognized as impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover, for certain equity method investments, decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Income if such decreases are judged to be an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Assessing if the fair value impairment is temporary is also inherently judgmental.The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of Citi&#8217;s own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental. For additional information on Citi&#8217;s fair value analysis, see Notes 6, 21 and 22 in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.77Citi&#8217;s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)The table below shows Citi&#8217;s allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and total ACL as of the first quarter of 2023.

See Notes 1 and 14.Citi&#8217;s reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans and for unfunded lending commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) and Other liabilities (for Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC)), respectively. In addition, Citi reserves for expected credit losses on other financial assets carried at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity securities, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowed, deposits with banks and other financial receivables. These reserves, together with the ACLL and ACLUC, are referred to as the ACL. Changes in the ACL are reflected as Provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for each reporting period. Citi&#8217;s ability to estimate expected credit losses over the reasonable and supportable (RS) period is based on the ability to forecast economic activity over an RS timeframe. The RS forecast period for consumer and corporate loans is eight quarters.The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components. The quantitative component uses three forward-looking macroeconomic forecast scenarios&#8212;base, upside and downside. The qualitative management adjustment component reflects risks and current economic conditions not fully captured in the quantitative component. Both the quantitative and qualitative components are further discussed below.Quantitative ComponentCiti estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) external credit bureau and rating agencies information and (iv) RS forecasts of macroeconomic conditions.For its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi&#8217;s expected credit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that consider the borrowers&#8217; probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables, including housing prices, unemployment and real GDP, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments.In addition, Citi&#8217;s models determine expected credit losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates, as well as other credit trends. 78Qualitative ComponentThe qualitative management adjustment component includes, among other things, management adjustments to reflect certain portfolio characteristics not fully captured in the quantitative component, such as idiosyncratic events and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. These may include but are not limited to:&#8226;Emerging macroeconomic risks due to uncertainties, including those related to potential global recession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices, geopolitical tensions and potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions&#8226;Normalization of portfolio performance and consumer behavior from record low losses as a result of government stimulus and market liquidityCiti&#8217;s qualitative component declined quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by releases of COVID-19&#8211;related uncertainty reserves as the portfolio continues to normalize toward pre-pandemic levels and as these risks are captured in the quantitative component of the ACL.Macroeconomic VariablesCiti considers a multitude of global macroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the ACL. Citi&#8217;s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL. The tables below show Citi&#8217;s forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic forecast for Citi&#8217;s ACL for each quarterly reporting period from 1Q22 to 1Q23:Quarterly averageU.S. unemployment2Q234Q232Q248-quarter average(1)Citi forecast at 1Q223.5&#160;%3.5&#160;%3.6&#160;%3.6&#160;%Citi forecast at 2Q223.7&#160;3.9&#160;3.9&#160;3.9&#160;Citi forecast at 3Q224.0&#160;4.3&#160;4.0&#160;4.1&#160;Citi forecast at 4Q224.2&#160;4.7&#160;4.5&#160;4.5&#160;Citi forecast at 1Q233.7&#160;4.3&#160;4.6&#160;4.3&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Represents the average unemployment rate for the rolling, forward-looking eight quarters in the forecast horizon.Year-over-year growth rate(1)Full yearU.S. real GDP202320242025Citi forecast at 1Q222.4&#160;%2.1&#160;%2.1&#160;%Citi forecast at 2Q221.8&#160;2.0&#160;2.1&#160;Citi forecast at 3Q220.6&#160;1.9&#160;2.7&#160;Citi forecast at 4Q220.3&#160;1.5&#160;2.2&#160;Citi forecast at 1Q231.0&#160;1.0&#160;2.0&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The year-over-year growth rate is the percentage change in the real (inflation adjusted) GDP level.Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of 1Q23, the U.S. real GDP growth declines for the remainder of 2023, and the unemployment rate increases over the forecast horizon. Scenario WeightingCiti&#8217;s ACL is estimated using three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios&#8212;base, upside and downside. The macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into consideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and other macroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis. Citi&#8217;s downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the base scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario, Citi&#8217;s downside scenario reflects a more severe recession, including an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8% over the eight-quarter RS period, with a peak difference between base and downside of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2024. The downside scenario also reflects a year-over-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2023 of 1.3%, with a peak quarter-over-quarter difference between base and downside of 1.0% in the second quarter of 2023.Citi&#8217;s ACL is sensitive to the various macroeconomic scenarios that drive the quantitative component of expected credit losses due to changes in the length and severity of forecasted economic variables or events in the respective scenarios. To demonstrate this sensitivity, Citi applied 100% weight to the downside scenario as of March 31, 2023, to reflect the most severe economic deterioration forecast in the multiple macroeconomic scenarios. Citi&#8217;s downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the weighted scenario assumptions; therefore, applying a 100% downside scenario weight would result in a hypothetical increase in the ACL of approximately $4.5 billion related to lending exposures, except for loans individually evaluated for credit losses.This analysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes to the qualitative component of the ACL. These factors could decrease the outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on historical experience and current conditions at the time of the assessment. Given the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic forecasting, Citi continues to believe that its ACL estimate based on a three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario approach combined with the qualitative component remains appropriate as of March 31, 2023.1Q23 Changes in the ACLAs further discussed below, Citi&#8217;s ending ACL balance for the first quarter of 2023 was $19.8 billion, compared to $19.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The change of $0.4 billion was driven by an ACL build of $0.6 billion, partially offset by the adoption of ASU 2022-02 related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs. The build was primarily driven by deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook (see &#8220;Macroeconomic Variables&#8221; above) and growth in card revolving balances in PBWM, partially offset by reductions in Russia loan exposures (see &#8220;Managing Global Risk&#8212;Other Risks&#8212;Russia&#8221; above). Based on its latest macroeconomic forecast, Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the 79forward view of the economic environment as of March&#160;31, 2023. See Note 14 for additional information.Consumer Allowance for Credit Losses on LoansCiti&#8217;s consumer ACLL is largely driven by U.S. Cards in U.S. Personal Banking. Citi&#8217;s total consumer ACLL build was $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in U.S. Cards revolving balances. In addition, the ACLL decreased $352 million from the adoption of ASU 2022-02 for the recognition and measurement of TDRs resulting in a March&#160;31, 2023 ACLL balance of $14.4 billion, or 3.96% of total funded consumer loans. For U.S. Cards, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans increased to 8.08% at March&#160;31, 2023, compared to 7.56% at December&#160;31, 2022. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans was 1.21% at March&#160;31, 2023, compared to 1.26% at December&#160;31, 2022.Corporate Allowance for Credit Losses on LoansCiti had a corporate ACLL release of $0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023. The release was primarily driven by reductions in Russia exposures. The ACLL reserve balance decreased by $0.1 billion to $2.8 billion, or 0.98% of total funded corporate loans. ACLUCCiti had an ACLUC release of $0.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023, which reduced the ACLUC reserve balance, included in Other liabilities, to $2.0 billion. The release was primarily driven by reductions in Russia exposures.ACL on Other Financial AssetsCiti had an ACL build on other financial assets carried at amortized cost of $0.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023, which increased the ACL reserve balance included in Other assets to $0.6 billion. The build was primarily driven by a reserve build related to an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. See Note 14 for additional information.ACLL and Non-accrual RatiosAt March&#160;31, 2023, the ratio of the ACLL to total funded loans was 2.65% (3.96% for consumer loans and 0.98% for corporate loans), compared to 2.60% at December&#160;31, 2022 (3.84% for consumer loans and 1.01% for corporate loans). Citi&#8217;s total non-accrual loans were $2.6 billion at March&#160;31, 2023, up $169 million from December&#160;31, 2022. Consumer non-accrual loans of $1.4 billion at March&#160;31, 2023 increased $78 million from December&#160;31, 2022. Corporate non-accrual loans increased $91 million to $1.2 billion at March&#160;31, 2023, compared to $1.1 billion at December&#160;31, 2022. In addition, the ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans was 0.42% and 0.38% for corporate and consumer loans, respectively, at March&#160;31, 2023 (for additional information on non-accrual loans, see &#8220;Additional Consumer and Corporate Credit Details&#8212;Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated Loans&#8221; above).Regulatory Capital ImpactCiti elected the modified CECL transition provision for regulatory capital purposes provided by the U.S. banking agencies&#8217; final rule. Accordingly, the Day One regulatory capital effects resulting from the adoption of CECL, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 and will be fully reflected in Citi&#8217;s regulatory capital as of January 1, 2025. See Notes 1 and 14 for a further description of the ACL and related accounts.GoodwillCiti tests goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include, among other things, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in Citi&#8217;s stock price.At October 1, 2022, the fair value of two reporting units (Banking and Mexico Consumer/SBMM) ranged from 102% to 106% of their carrying values. The carrying values of the Banking and Mexico Consumer/SBMM reporting units included approximately $1.5 billion and $1 billion of goodwill, respectively. For each of the remaining reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10%.While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations of the reporting units, the economic and business environments continue to evolve as Citi&#8217;s management implements its strategic refresh. If management&#8217;s future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future. See Note 15 for a further discussion of goodwill.Litigation AccrualsSee the discussion in Note 25 for information regarding Citi&#8217;s policies on establishing accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies.80INCOME TAXES Effective Tax RateThree Months Ended March 31,In millions of dollars, except effective tax rate20232022Income from continuing operations before income tax expense$6,183$5,266Provision for income taxes1,531941Effective tax rate25&#160;%18&#160;%Citi&#8217;s effective tax rate was 25% in the first quarter of 2023, including the impact of divestitures, versus 18% in the first quarter of 2022, which had higher discrete tax benefits reflecting the resolution of certain tax audit items.Deferred Tax Assets For additional information on Citi&#8217;s deferred tax assets (DTAs), see &#8220;Capital Resources,&#8221; &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Strategic Risks,&#8221; &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates&#8212;Income Taxes&#8221; and Notes 1 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. The table below summarizes Citi&#8217;s net DTAs balance:Jurisdiction/ComponentDTAs balanceIn billions of dollars March 31,2023December 31, 2022Total U.S. $25.1&#160;$24.8&#160;Total foreign 2.5&#160;2.9&#160;Total $27.6&#160;$27.7&#160;At March 31, 2023, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of approximately $27.6 billion, a decrease of $0.1 billion from December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily a result of gains in Other comprehensive income. Of Citi&#8217;s $27.6 billion of net DTAs, $16.4 billion was not deducted in calculating regulatory capital and was appropriately risk weighted under the Basel III rules.The remaining $11.2 billion (compared to $11.0 billion at December 31, 2022) was deducted in calculating Citi&#8217;s regulatory capital. The $11.2 billion of DTA deducted from regulatory capital was composed of $11.8 billion related to tax carry-forwards and $1.1 billion of temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15% regulatory limitations, and was reduced by $1.7 billion of deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that were separately deducted from capital. The largest component of the increase in the DTA deducted from Citi&#8217;s regulatory capital during the quarter was related to temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15% limitations ($1.1 billion at March 31, 2023 compared to $0.3 billion at December 31, 2022), primarily attributable to higher temporary differences in DTAs subject to the limitation. DTA RealizabilityCiti believes that realization of the net DTAs of $27.6 billion at March&#160;31, 2023 is more-likely-than-not, based on management&#8217;s expectations of future taxable income generation in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes).81 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESCiti&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms, including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Citi&#8217;s Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of Citi&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO.Citi&#8217;s management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule&#160;13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of March&#160;31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date Citigroup&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACTPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Citi did not identify any reportable activities pursuant to Section 219 for the first quarter of 2023.During the first quarter of 2023, Citigroup identified one transaction pursuant to Section 219 related to the fourth quarter of 2022. On November 4, 2022, Citibank, N.A., Dubai Branch, issued a manager&#8217;s check to a Specially Designated National, who was designated on November 3, 2022, pursuant to the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations. The check was issued less than 24 hours after the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)&#8217;s designation of the individual, while Citibank&#8217;s sanctions screening system was in the process of being updated. The total value of the payment was equivalent to USD 350,876.10 and was paid out on November 5, 2022. Citibank, N.A. realized the equivalent of USD 8.50 in fees for the issuance of the check. Once identified, the transaction was disclosed to OFAC.82FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain statements in this Form 10-Q, including but not limited to statements included within the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, Citigroup may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and its management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.Generally, forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent Citigroup&#8217;s and its management&#8217;s beliefs regarding future events.

foreign currency volatility and devaluations; distress and volatility in emerging markets, including sovereign debt pricing; geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including those related to Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine; protracted or widespread trade tensions; and election outcomes;&#8226;the potential impact on Citi&#8217;s ability to return capital to common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets, due to, among other things: regulatory capital requirements, including annual recalibration of the Stress Capital Buffer, which is based upon the results of the CCAR process; recalibration of the GSIB surcharge; Citi&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition; the capital impacts related to Citi&#8217;s remaining consumer banking divestitures, including any temporary capital impacts from CTA losses (net of hedges) between transaction signings and closings, and achievement of the expected benefits from the divestitures; Citi&#8217;s effectiveness in planning, managing and calculating its level of risk-weighted assets under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach and Supplementary Leverage ratio and GSIB surcharge; Citi&#8217;s implementation and maintenance of an effective capital planning framework; forecasts of macroeconomic conditions; Citi&#8217;s DTA utilization; and changes in regulatory capital rules, requirements or interpretations, such as revisions to the U.S. Basel III rules;&#8226;the ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes faced by financial institutions, including Citi, in the U.S. and globally, such as potential fiscal, monetary, regulatory, tax, sanctions and other changes, including potential increased regulatory requirements and costs resulting from recent bank failures; potential changes to various aspects of the regulatory capital framework; future legislative and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and globally relating to climate change, including any new disclosure requirements, such as those proposed by the SEC;

governmental fiscal and monetary policies; regulatory changes; negative investor perceptions of Citi&#8217;s creditworthiness; competition for funding, including a decrease in demand for corporate debt, unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements, and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources; the competitive environment for deposits; changes in Citi&#8217;s credit spreads; higher interest rates; and changes in currency exchange rates;&#8226;the impact of a credit ratings downgrade of Citi or certain of its subsidiaries or issuing entities on Citi&#8217;s funding and liquidity as well as on the operations of certain of its businesses;&#8226;the potential impact to Citi of ongoing interpretation and implementation of regulatory and legislative requirements and changes in the U.S. and globally, as well as heightened regulatory scrutiny and expectations for large financial institutions and their employees and agents, with respect to governance, infrastructure, data, climate and risk management practices and controls, customer and client protection, market practices, anti-money laundering and increasingly complex sanctions and disclosure regimes, including the impact on Citi&#8217;s compliance, regulatory and other risks and costs, such as increased regulatory oversight and restrictions, enforcement proceedings, penalties and fines;&#8226;the potential outcomes of the extensive legal and regulatory proceedings, examinations, investigations, consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries, to which Citi is or may be subject at any given time, such as the previously disclosed October 2020 FRB and OCC consent orders, particularly given the increased focus by regulators on risks and controls, such as enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data quality management and governance and internal controls, and policies and procedures; Citi&#8217;s ability to implement targeted actions plans and submit quarterly progress reports detailing the results and status of improvements to comply with the consent orders on a timely and sufficient basis, which will continue to require significant investments to meet regulatory expectations; the heightened scrutiny and expectations generally from regulators, and the severity of the remedies sought by regulators, such as significant monetary penalties, supervisory or enforcement orders, business restrictions, limitations on dividends and changes to directors and/or officers and collateral consequences to Citi arising from such outcomes;&#8226;the various risks faced by Citi as a result of its presence in the emerging markets, including, among others, limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign investments;

BASIS OF PRESENTATION, UPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES Basis of PresentationThe accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements as of March&#160;31, 2023 and for the three-month periods ended March&#160;31, 2023 and 2022 include the accounts of Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included within Citigroup&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been condensed or omitted.Management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnote disclosures. While management uses its best judgment, actual results could differ from those estimates. As noted above, the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited. Throughout these Notes, &#8220;Citigroup,&#8221; &#8220;Citi&#8221; and &#8220;the Company&#8221; refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.Certain reclassifications and updates have been made to the prior periods&#8217; financial statements and notes to conform to the current period&#8217;s presentation.Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in Cash and due from banks and predominately all of Deposits with banks. Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities. Amounts included in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with banks approximate fair value.UPDATED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe accounting policies below have been updated from those disclosed in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2022 Form 10-K) as a result of accounting standards adopted during the first quarter of 2023. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a summary of all of Citigroup&#8217;s significant accounting policies.Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures under the methodology described below. For information about Citi&#8217;s accounting for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) prior to January 1, 2023, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the ACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. With the elimination of TDR accounting requirements, reasonably expected TDRs are no longer considered when determining the term over which to estimate expected credit losses. The ACLL for modified loans that are collateral dependent continues to be based on the fair value of the collateral.Consumer LoansUpon adoption of the ASU on January 1, 2023, Citi discontinued the use of a DCF approach for consumer loans formerly considered TDRs. Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi measures the ACLL for all consumer loans under approaches that do not incorporate discounting, primarily utilizing models that consider the borrowers&#8217; probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. In addition, upon adoption of the ASU, Citi collectively evaluates smaller-balance homogenous loans formerly considered TDRs for expected credit losses, whereas previously those loans had been individually evaluated.95ACCOUNTING CHANGESTDRs and Vintage DisclosuresIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. Citi adopted the ASU on January 1, 2023. Citi adopted the guidance on the recognition and measurement of TDRs under the modified retrospective approach. See the &#8220;ACL&#8221; section under the &#8220;Updated Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; heading in this Note above for a description of the ASU&#8217;s amendments to the TDR recognition and measurement guidance. Adopting those amendments resulted in a decrease to the ACLL of $352&#160;million and an increase in other assets related to held-for-sale businesses of $44&#160;million, with a corresponding increase to retained earnings of $290&#160;million and a decrease in deferred tax assets of $106&#160;million on January 1, 2023. The ACL for corporate loans was unaffected because the measurement approach used for corporate loans is not in the scope of this ASU. The ASU also requires disclosure of modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty if the modification involves principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a combination of those types of modifications. In addition, the ASU requires the disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of loan origination (vintage). The amendments related to disclosures are required to be applied prospectively beginning as of the date of adoption. See Note 13 for these new disclosures for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2023.Fair Value Hedging&#8212;Portfolio Layer Method In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging&#8212;Portfolio Layer Method, intended to better align hedge accounting with an organization&#8217;s risk management strategies. Specifically, the guidance expands the current single-layer method to allow multiple hedge layers of a single closed portfolio of qualifying assets, which include both prepayable and non-prepayable assets. Coincident with the adoption of this ASU, on January 1, 2023, Citi transferred HTM mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost and fair value of approximately $3.3&#160;billion and $3.4&#160;billion, respectively, into AFS as permitted under the guidance, and hedged them under the portfolio layer method. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized gain position of $0.1&#160;billion, which was recorded in AOCI upon transfer.Long-Duration Insurance ContractsIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial Services&#8212;Insurance: Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, which changes the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. Specifically, the guidance (i) improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits and prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for long-duration insurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves the accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and (iv) introduces additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has certain insurance subsidiaries, primarily in Mexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts such as traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent annuity contracts that are impacted by the requirements of ASU 2018-12.The effective date of ASU 2018-12 was deferred for all insurance entities by ASU 2019-09, Financial Services&#8212;Insurance: Effective Date (issued in October 2019) and by ASU 2020-11, Financial Services&#8212;Insurance: Effective Date and Early Application (issued in November 2020). Citi adopted the targeted improvements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023, resulting in a $39&#160;million decrease in Other liabilities and a $27&#160;million increase in AOCI, after-tax. Voluntary Change in Goodwill Impairment Assessment DateDuring 2022, the Company voluntarily changed its annual goodwill impairment assessment date from July 1 to October 1. See Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information. Multiple Macroeconomic Scenarios-Based ACL ApproachDuring the second quarter of 2022, Citi refined its ACL methodology to utilize multiple macroeconomic scenarios to estimate its allowance for credit losses. The ACL was previously estimated using a combination of a single base-case forecast scenario as part of its quantitative component and a component of its qualitative management adjustment that reflects economic uncertainty from downside macroeconomic scenarios. As a result of this change, Citi now explicitly incorporates multiple macroeconomic scenarios&#8212;base, upside, and downside&#8212;and associated probabilities in the quantitative component when estimating its ACL, while still retaining certain of its qualitative management adjustments.This refinement represents a &#8220;change in accounting estimate&#8221; under ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, with prospective application beginning in the period of change. This change in accounting estimate resulted in a decrease of approximately $0.3&#160;billion in the allowance for credit losses in the second quarter of 2022, partially offsetting an increase of $0.8&#160;billion in the allowance for credit losses due to the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and other factors in the second quarter of 2022.FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGESAccounting for Investments in Tax Credit StructuresIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023&#8208;02, Investments&#8212;Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 3232): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method. The ASU expands the scope of tax equity investments eligible to apply the proportional amortization method of accounting. Under the proportional amortization method, the cost of an eligible investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits that are received by the investor, 96with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as components of income tax expense (benefit). Prior to the issuance of this ASU, use of the proportional amortization method was limited to tax equity investments in Low&#8208;Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) structures, and all other tax equity investments were typically accounted for using the equity method of accounting, which resulted in investment income, gains and losses, and tax credits being presented gross on the income statement in their respective line items. The ASU will permit the Company to elect to use the proportional amortization method to account for all eligible tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, if certain conditions are met. For public entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, although early adoption is permitted in any interim period. However, if an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it shall adopt them as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. Adoption of the ASU must be applied on either a retrospective or a modified retrospective basis. Citi plans to adopt the ASU on January 1, 2024 and is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on tax equity investments. Citi does not expect a material impact to its results of operations as a result of adopting the standard.Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale RestrictionsIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-3, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The ASU was issued to address diversity in practice whereby certain entities included the impact of contractual restrictions when valuing equity securities, and it clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, should not be considered in measuring fair value. The ASU also includes requirements for entities to disclose the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions. The ASU is to be adopted on a prospective basis and will be effective for Citi on January 1, 2024, although early adoption is permitted. Adoption of the accounting standard is not expected to have an impact on Citi&#8217;s operating results or financial position, as the Company excludes such restrictions when valuing equity securities. 972. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS AND OTHER BUSINESS EXITSSummary of Discontinued OperationsThe Company&#8217;s results from Discontinued operations consisted of residual activities related to the sales of the Egg Banking plc credit card business in 2011 and the German retail banking business in 2008. All Discontinued operations results are recorded within Corporate/Other. The following table summarizes financial information for all Discontinued operations:Three Months Ended March 31,In millions of dollars20232022Total revenues, net of interest expense$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;Income (loss) from discontinued operations$(1)$(2)Benefit for income taxes&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes$(1)$(2)Cash flows from Discontinued operations were not material for the periods presented. 98Significant Disposals As of March&#160;31, 2023, Citi had entered into sale agreements for nine consumer banking businesses within Legacy Franchises. Australia closed in the second quarter of 2022, the Philippines closed in the third quarter of 2022, Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and India and Vietnam closed in the first quarter of 2023. Entry of sale agreements for the Taiwan and Indonesia consumer banking businesses has resulted in the reclassification to HFS on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $14&#160;billion in assets within Other assets, including approximately $8&#160;billion of loans (net of allowance of $66&#160;million), and approximately $11&#160;billion in liabilities within Other liabilities, including approximately $11&#160;billion in deposits. Of the nine sale agreements, the five below were identified as significant disposals as of March&#160;31, 2023.

The business had approximately $9.4&#160;billion in assets, including $9.3&#160;billion of loans (net of allowance of $140&#160;million) and excluding goodwill. The total amount of liabilities was $7.3&#160;billion including $6.8&#160;billion in deposits. The transaction generated a pretax loss on sale of approximately $760&#160;million ($640&#160;million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue. The loss on sale primarily reflected the impact of an approximate pretax $620&#160;million CTA loss (net of hedges) ($470&#160;million after-tax) already reflected in the AOCI component of equity. The sale closed on June 1, 2022, and the CTA-related balance was removed from AOCI, resulting in a neutral CTA impact to Citi&#8217;s CET1 Capital. The income before taxes shown in the above table for Australia reflects Citi&#8217;s ownership through June 1, 2022.(3)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On August 1, 2022, Citi completed the sale of its Philippines consumer banking business, which was part of Legacy Franchises.

The total amount of liabilities was $1.3&#160;billion, including $1.2&#160;billion in deposits. The sale resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $618&#160;million ($290&#160;million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue. The income before taxes shown in the above table for the Philippines reflects Citi&#8217;s ownership through August 1, 2022.(4)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On November 1, 2022, Citi completed the sale of its Thailand consumer banking business, which was part of Legacy Franchises.

The total amount of liabilities was $1.0&#160;billion, including $0.8&#160;billion in deposits. The sale resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $209&#160;million ($115&#160;million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue. The income before taxes shown in the above table for Thailand reflects Citi&#8217;s ownership through November 1, 2022.(5)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On March 1, 2023, Citi completed the sale of its India consumer banking business, which was part of Legacy Franchises.

As of May&#160;5, 2023, Citi had not entered into sale agreements for the remaining Legacy Franchises businesses to be sold, specifically the Poland consumer banking business and the Mexico Consumer/SBMM businesses.For a description of the Company&#8217;s significant disposal transactions in prior periods and financial impact, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.Other Business ExitsWind-Down of Korea Consumer Banking BusinessOn October 25, 2021, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down and close its Korea consumer banking business, which is reported in the Legacy Franchises operating segment. In connection with the announcement, Citibank Korea Inc. (CKI) commenced a voluntary early termination program (Korea VERP). Due to the voluntary nature of this termination program, no liabilities for termination benefits are recorded until CKI makes formal offers to employees that are then irrevocably accepted by those employees. Related charges are recorded as Compensation and benefits. The following table summarizes the reserve charges related to the Korea VERP and other initiatives reported in the Legacy Franchises operating segment and Corporate/Other:In millions of dollarsEmployee termination costs Total Citigroup (pretax)Original charges in fourth quarter 2021$1,052&#160;Utilization(1)Foreign exchange3&#160;Balance at December 31, 2021$1,054&#160;Additional charges in first quarter 2022$31&#160;Utilization(347)Foreign exchange(24)Balance at March 31, 2022$714&#160;Additional charges (releases)$(3)Utilization(670)Foreign exchange(41)Balance at June 30, 2022$&#8212;&#160;Additional charges (releases)$&#8212;&#160;Utilization&#8212;&#160;Foreign exchange&#8212;&#160;Balance at September 30, 2022$&#8212;&#160;The total cash charges for the wind-down were $1.1&#160;billion through 2022, most of which were recognized in 2021. Citi does not expect to record any additional charges in connection with the Korea VERP. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for details on the pension impact of the Korea wind-down.Wind-Down of Russia Consumer and Institutional Banking BusinessesOn August 25, 2022, Citi announced its decision to wind down its consumer banking and local commercial banking operations in Russia. As part of the wind-down, Citi is also actively pursuing sales of certain Russian consumer banking portfolios.On October 14, 2022, Citi disclosed that it will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services it offers in Russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Going forward, Citi&#8217;s only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations.On December 12, 2022, Citi completed the sale of a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal installment loans, totaling approximately $240&#160;million in outstanding loan balances, to Uralsib, a Russian commercial bank, resulting in a pretax net loss of approximately $12&#160;million. The net loss on sale of the loan portfolio included a $32&#160;million adjustment to record the loans at lower of cost or fair value recognized in Other revenue. In addition, the sale of the loans resulted in a release in the allowance for credit losses on loans of approximately $20&#160;million recognized in the Provision for credit losses on loans. Citi&#8217;s referral agreement with a Russian bank for a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject to customer consents, can be terminated under certain circumstances and is being reevaluated as Citi reviews other alternatives. As a result, the credit card loans will remain held-for-investment and are not transferred to held-for-sale. During the first quarter of 2023, Citi recorded a pretax charge of approximately $7&#160;million and $5&#160;million (approximately $30&#160;million and $10&#160;million program-to-date) as Compensation and benefits composed of severance costs, reported in Legacy Franchises and Institutional Clients Group, respectively. Citi also recorded a pretax charge of approximately $6&#160;million (approximately $13&#160;million program-to-date) as Other operating expenses composed of vendor termination and other costs, reported in Legacy Franchises.In connection with this wind-down, Citi expects to incur approximately $210&#160;million in total estimated charges ($60&#160;million in ICG and $150&#160;million in Legacy Franchises, excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), largely driven by restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges.1003. OPERATING SEGMENTSThe operating segments and reporting units reflect how the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker, manages the Company, including allocating resources and measuring performance. Citigroup&#8217;s activities are conducted through three operating segments: Institutional Clients Group (ICG), Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM) and Legacy Franchises, with Corporate/Other including activities not assigned to a specific operating segment, as well as discontinued operations. ICG consists of Services, Markets and Banking, providing corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services.PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth), providing traditional banking services and credit cards to retail and small business customers in the U.S., and financial services to clients from affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through banking, lending, mortgages, investment, custody and trust product offerings in 20 countries, including the U.S., Mexico and the four wealth management centers: Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London.Legacy Franchises consists of Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer/SBMM businesses that Citi intends to exit, and its remaining Legacy Holdings Assets.Corporate/Other includes activities not assigned to the operating segments, including certain unallocated costs of global functions, other corporate expenses and corporate treasury results, offsets to certain line-item reclassifications and eliminations, and unallocated taxes, as well as discontinued operations.Revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment or component are included in determining respective operating results. Other revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular business segment or component are generally allocated from Corporate/Other based on respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.As a result of revenues and expenses from transactions with other operating segments or components being treated as transactions with external parties for purposes of segment disclosures, the Company includes intersegment eliminations within Corporate/Other to reconcile the business segment results to Citi&#8217;s consolidated results.The accounting policies of these operating segments are the same as those disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.

These agreements are subject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if met, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. The threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is generally calculated based on predefined program revenues less predefined program expenses. In most of Citi&#8217;s partner sharing agreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to the extent that an increase in net credit losses reduces Citi&#8217;s liability for the partners&#8217; share for a given program year, would generally result in lower payments to partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other partner payments are based on program sales and new account acquisitions.(2)Overdraft fees are accounted for under ASC 310. Citi eliminated overdraft fees, returned item fees and overdraft protection fees beginning in June 2022. Includes overdraft fees (prior to the elimination of overdraft fees in June 2022) of $0 and $32&#160;million for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (3)Consists primarily of fees earned from structuring and underwriting loan syndications or related financing activity. This activity is accounted for under ASC 310.(4)Commissions and fees include $(2,656)&#160;million and $(2,427)&#160;million not accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amounts reported in Commissions and fees accounted for under other guidance primarily include card-related loan fees, card reward programs and certain partner payments, corporate finance fees, insurance premiums and loan servicing fees.103The following tables present Administration and other fiduciary fees revenue:Three Months Ended March 31, 2023In millions of dollarsICGPBWMLegacy FranchisesTotalCustody fees$418&#160;$20&#160;$6&#160;$444&#160;Fiduciary fees75&#160;153&#160;82&#160;310&#160;Guarantee fees132&#160;8&#160;2&#160;142&#160;Total administration and other fiduciary fees(1)$625&#160;$181&#160;$90&#160;$896&#160;Three Months Ended March 31, 2022In millions of dollarsICGPBWMLegacy FranchisesTotalCustody fees$447&#160;$23&#160;$3&#160;$473&#160;Fiduciary fees64&#160;205&#160;80&#160;349&#160;Guarantee fees132&#160;10&#160;2&#160;144&#160;Total administration and other fiduciary fees(1)$643&#160;$238&#160;$85&#160;$966&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Administration and other fiduciary fees include $142&#160;million and $144&#160;million for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, that are not accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. These generally include guarantee fees.1046. PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONSPrincipal transactions revenue consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions that are managed on a portfolio basis and characterized below based on the primary risk managed by each trading desk (as such, the trading desks can be periodically reorganized and thus the risk categories). Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income related to trading activities, which is an integral part of trading activities&#8217; profitability (see Note 4 for information about net interest income related to trading activities). Principal transactions include CVA (credit valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding valuation adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and gains (losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in ICG. These adjustments are discussed further in Note 21. In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these fees paid to third parties in operating expenses.

Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of all settlements (including lump-sum payments) for the year is greater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of the plan&#8217;s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because some of Citi&#8217;s significant plans are frozen and have no material service cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.107The following table shows the change in AOCI related to the Company&#8217;s pension, postretirement and post employment plans:In&#160;millions&#160;of&#160;dollarsThree Months EndedMarch 31, 2023Twelve Months EndedDecember 31, 2022Three Months Ended March 31, 2022Beginning of period balance, net of tax(1)(2)$(5,755)$(5,852)$(5,852)Actuarial assumptions changes and plan experience(269)3,923&#160;1,525&#160;Net asset gain (loss) due to difference between actual and expected returns183&#160;(4,225)(1,462)Net amortization43&#160;198&#160;64&#160;Curtailment/settlement (gain)(3)(5)(37)&#8212;&#160;Foreign exchange impact and other(108)172&#160;50&#160;Change in deferred taxes, net52&#160;66&#160;(6)Change, net of tax$(104)$97&#160;$171&#160;End of period balance, net of tax(1)(2)$(5,859)$(5,755)$(5,681)(1)See Note 18 for further discussion of net AOCI balance.(2)Includes net-of-tax amounts for certain profit-sharing plans outside the U.S.(3)Curtailment and settlement relate to divestiture activities.Plan AssumptionsCertain assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the Significant Plans are as follows:During the periodThree Months EndedMar. 31, 2023Dec. 31, 2022Mar. 31, 2022Discount rateU.S. plansQualified pension5.50%5.65%2.80%Nonqualified pension5.555.602.80Postretirement5.605.652.75Non-U.S. plans&#160;&#160;Pension 2.20&#8211;10.602.10&#8211;11.300.25&#8211;9.80Weighted average7.557.644.56Postretirement10.6011.2510.00Expected return on assetsU.S. plansQualified pension5.705.005.00Postretirement5.70/3.005.00/1.505.00/1.50Non-U.S. plansPension4.50&#8211;9.902.00&#8211;8.001.50&#8211;8.00Weighted average6.405.483.78Postretirement8.708.008.00At period endedMar. 31, 2023Dec. 31, 2022Mar. 31, 2022Discount rateU.S. plansQualified pension5.15%5.50%3.80%Nonqualified pension5.205.553.85Postretirement5.255.603.85Non-U.S. plans&#160;&#160;&#160;Pension 2.05&#8211;10.652.20&#8211;10.601.10&#8211;10.00Weighted average7.647.555.55Postretirement10.7010.6010.10Expected return on assetsU.S. plansQualified pension5.705.705.50Postretirement5.70/3.005.70/3.005.50/1.50Non-U.S. plansPension4.10&#8211;9.904.50&#8211;9.901.90&#8211;8.00Weighted average6.266.404.15Postretirement8.708.708.00Sensitivities of Certain Key AssumptionsThe following table summarizes the estimated effect on the Company&#8217;s Significant Plans quarterly expense of a one-percentage-point change in the discount rate:Three Months Ended March 31, 2023In&#160;millions&#160;of&#160;dollarsOne-percentage-point increaseOne-percentage-point decreasePensionU.S. plans$6&#160;$(7)Non-U.S. plans(1)3&#160;PostretirementNon-U.S. plans(1)1&#160;108ContributionsFor the U.S. pension plans, there were no required minimum cash contributions during the first three months of 2023.

The election to measure a non-marketable equity security using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.Equity securities under the measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired. For details on impairment indicators that are considered, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. When the qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, the investment is written down to fair value, with the full difference between the fair value of the investment and its carrying amount recognized in earnings.Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022:In millions of dollarsMarch 31, 2023December 31, 2022Measurement alternative:Carrying value$1,619&#160;$1,676&#160;Below are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date amounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative:Three Months Ended March 31,In millions of dollars20232022Measurement alternative(1):Impairment losses$35&#160;$&#8212;&#160;Downward changes for observable prices20&#160;&#8212;&#160;Upward changes for observable prices30&#160;85&#160;(1) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;See Note 21 for additional information on these nonrecurring fair value measurements.

The table above has been revised to reflect the correct origination year. Citi evaluated the effect of the revision, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and concluded that the impact of the revision was not material. The impact of the revision increased (decreased) the year of origination amounts as follows: $(24.9)&#160;billion, $2.0&#160;billion, $3.2&#160;billion, $4.6&#160;billion, $4.1&#160;billion and $11.0&#160;billion for 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and prior, respectively.127Gross Credit LossesThe table below details gross credit losses recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2023, by year of loan origination:&#160;For the period ended March 31, 2023In millions of dollars20232022202120202019Prior Revolving line of credit arrangementTotal Commercial and industrial$1&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$35&#160;$36&#160;Financial institutions&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Mortgage and real estate&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Other(1)&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;3&#160;3&#160;Total$1&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$38&#160;$39&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.Non-Accrual Corporate Loans&#160;March 31, 2023December 31, 2022In millions of dollarsRecordedinvestment(1)(2)Related specificallowanceRecordedinvestment(1)(2)Related specificallowanceNon-accrual corporate loans with specific allowances&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Commercial and industrial$592&#160;$253&#160;$583&#160;$268&#160;Financial institutions154&#160;70&#160;149&#160;51&#160;Mortgage and real estate46&#160;5&#160;33&#160;4&#160;Other4&#160;1&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Total non-accrual corporate loans with specific allowances$796&#160;$329&#160;$765&#160;$323&#160;Non-accrual corporate loans without specific allowances&#160;&#160;Commercial and industrial$317&#160;N/A$277&#160;N/AFinancial institutions4&#160;N/A3&#160;N/AMortgage and real estate43&#160;N/A&#8212;&#160;N/ALease financing&#8212;&#160;N/A10&#160;N/AOther53&#160;N/A67&#160;N/ATotal non-accrual corporate loans without specific allowances$417&#160;N/A$357&#160;N/A(1)Recorded investment in a loan includes net deferred loan fees and costs, unamortized premium or discount, less any direct write-downs.(2)Interest income recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 was $11&#160;million, $15&#160;million and $11&#160;million, respectively.N/A Not applicable128Corporate Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty Citi seeks to modify certain corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to reduce Citi&#8217;s exposure to loss, often providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties. Each modification is unique to the borrower&#8217;s individual circumstances. The following table details corporate loan modifications granted during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification granted and the financial effect of those modifications. Citi defines a corporate loan modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as a modification of a loan classified as substandard or worse at the time of modification.For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023In millions of dollars, except for weighted average term extensionTotal modifications balance at March 31,2023(1)(2)(3)Term extensionCombination:Term extension and payment delay(5)Weighted average term extension(months)Commercial and industrial$70&#160;$40&#160;$30&#160;15Financial institutions&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Mortgage and real estate6&#160;6&#160;&#8212;&#160;4Other(4)&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Total$76&#160;$46&#160;$30&#160;(1)The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding as of the end of the reporting period. The balances are not significant as a percentage of the total carrying values of loans by class of receivable as of March 31, 2023.(2)Commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were granted modifications totaled $368&#160;million as of March 31, 2023.(3)The allowance for corporate loans, including modified loans, is based on the borrower&#8217;s overall financial performance. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the modification or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification.(4)Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.(5)Payment delays either for principal or interest payments were immaterial.

Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans&#8217; projected cash flows and thus little to no impact on the allowance established for the loans.&#160;Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification.(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate.(3)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.129Performance of Modified Corporate LoansThe following table presents the delinquencies of modified corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, including loans that were modified during the three months ended March 31, 2023:&#160;As of March 31, 2023(1)In millions of dollarsTotal Current30&#8211;89 days past due90+ days past dueCommercial and industrial$70&#160;$70&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;Financial institutions&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Mortgage and real estate6&#160;6&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Other(2)&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Total$76&#160;$76&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;(1)Corporate loans are generally not modified as a result of their delinquency status; rather, they are modified because of events that have impacted the overall financial performance of the borrower. Corporate loans, if past due, are re-aged to current status upon modification. (2)Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.Defaults of Modified Corporate LoansNo modified corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty defaulted during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is defined as 90 days past due. For a modified corporate loan that is not collateral dependent, expected default rates are considered in the loan&#8217;s individually assessed ACL.In&#160;millions&#160;of&#160;dollarsTDR balances at March 31, 2022TDR loans that re-defaulted in 2022 within one year of modificationCommercial and industrial$205&#160;$&#8212;&#160;Mortgage and real estate20&#160;&#8212;&#160;Other(1)23&#160;&#8212;&#160;Total(2)$248&#160;$&#8212;&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding that were considered TDRs as of the end of the reporting period.130 Consumer LoansConsumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by PBWM and Legacy Franchises (except Mexico SBMM).

Citi uses various metrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the time of modification. Citi&#8217;s significant consumer modification programs are described below.Credit CardsCiti seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering long-term loan modification programs. These modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer&#8217;s available line of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure customers&#8217; entire unsecured debt. In both circumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi&#8217;s standard charge-off policy.Residential MortgagesCiti seeks to assist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate reductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term extensions or combinations thereof. In the U.S., before permanently modifying a mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial modifications generally represent a three-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, Citi and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects most loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be granted permanent modifications. At March 31, 2023, $25&#160;million of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs. At March 31, 2023, mortgage loans of $1&#160;million had gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the three months ended March 31, 2023.140Types of Consumer Loan Modifications and Their Financial EffectThe following table provides details on permanent consumer loan modifications granted during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification granted and the financial effect of those modifications: &#160;For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023In millions of dollars, except weighted averagesModifications as % of loansTotal modifications balance at March 31, 2023(1)(2)(3)Interest rate reductionTerm extensionPayment delayCombination: interest rate reduction and term extension&#160;Combination: term extension and payment delay(4) Combination: interest rate reduction, term extension and payment delayWeighted average interest rate reduction %Weighted average term extension (months)Weighted average delay in payments (months)In North America offices(5)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Residential first mortgages(6)0.05&#160;%$52&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$15&#160;$34&#160;$3&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;2&#160;%1836Home equity loans0.19&#160;8&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;3&#160;5&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;3&#160;1205Credit cards0.19&#160;276&#160;276&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;22&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Personal, small business and other0.01&#160;2&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;2&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;7&#160;16&#8212;&#160;Total0.12&#160;%$338&#160;$276&#160;$15&#160;$37&#160;$10&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;In offices outside North America(5)Residential mortgages0.97&#160;%$260&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$17&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$242&#160;$1&#160;&#8212;&#160;%11Credit cards0.09&#160;12&#160;12&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;18&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Personal, small business and other0.02&#160;7&#160;1&#160;2&#160;&#8212;&#160;4&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;6&#160;206Total0.36&#160;%$279&#160;$13&#160;$2&#160;$17&#160;$4&#160;$242&#160;$1&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding as of the end of the reporting period.

The increase in the ACLL was primarily driven by macroeconomic deterioration and growth in card revolving balances, partially offset by a decrease in the ACLL of $352&#160;million from the adoption of ASU 2022-02 for the recognition and measurement of TDRs (see Note 1) and a decrease in the ACLUC primarily driven by reductions in Russia exposures. Consumer ACLLCiti&#8217;s total consumer allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) as of March&#160;31, 2023 was $14,389 million, an increase from $14,119&#160;million at December&#160;31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in U.S. Cards revolving balances, partially offset by a decrease to the ACLL of $352&#160;million from the adoption of ASU 2022-02 for the recognition and measurement of TDRs.Corporate ACLLCiti&#8217;s total corporate ACLL as of March&#160;31, 2023 was $2,780 million, a decrease from $2,855&#160;million at December&#160;31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by reductions in Russia exposures. ACLUCAs of March&#160;31, 2023, Citi&#8217;s total ACLUC, included in Other liabilities, was $1,959 million, a decrease from $2,151&#160;million at December&#160;31, 2022.

These SPEs are not consolidated.(5) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored private equity funds, which represent $10&#160;billion and $69&#160;billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $252&#160;million and $498&#160;million in maximum exposure to loss as of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively.154The previous tables do not include:&#8226;certain investment funds for which the Company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services;&#8226;certain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related commitment. As of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions was $25.2&#160;billion and $33.6&#160;billion, respectively (for more information on these positions, see Note 13 and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K);&#8226;certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company holds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on arm&#8217;s-length terms;&#8226;certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are classified as Trading account assets or Investments, in which the Company has no other involvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 12 and 21 for more information on these positions);&#8226;certain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and&#8226;VIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the Company&#8217;s funding activities. The Company does not have a variable interest in these trusts.The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that classification.The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily available to the Company.The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Company&#8217;s investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts.155The following tables present certain assets and liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are included on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets in the table below include those assets that can only be used to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs, presented on the following page, and are in excess of those obligations.

The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $50&#160;billion and $47&#160;billion as of March&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs:Three Months Ended March 31,In millions of dollars20232022Balance, beginning of period$665&#160;$404&#160;Originations12&#160;34&#160;Changes in fair value of MSRs due to changes in inputs and assumptions(3)98&#160;Other changes(1)(16)(17)Sales of MSRs&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Balance, as of March 31$658&#160;$519&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Represents changes due to customer payments and passage of time.The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading account assets. The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees were as follows:Three Months Ended March 31,In millions of dollars20232022Servicing fees$33&#160;$29&#160;Late fees1&#160;1&#160;Total MSR fees$34&#160;$30&#160;In the Consolidated Statement of Income these fees are primarily classified as Commissions and fees, and changes in MSR fair values are classified as Other revenue.Re-securitizationsThe Company engages in re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023 and 2022. These securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients.As of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, Citi held no retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi. The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately $5.3&#160;billion to re-securitization entities, compared to approximately $9.3&#160;billion for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2022. As of March&#160;31, 2023, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $1.4&#160;billion (including $268&#160;million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2023), compared to $1.4&#160;billion as of December&#160;31, 2022 (including $801&#160;million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2022), which is recorded in Trading account assets. The original fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in which Citi holds a retained interest as of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022 were approximately $86.6&#160;billion and $79.4 billion, respectively.As of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, the Company did not consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization entities.Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper ConduitsAt March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately $19.4&#160;billion and $19.6 billion of purchased assets outstanding, respectively, and had incremental funding commitments with clients of approximately $14.2&#160;billion and $13.9 billion, respectively.Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, the weighted average remaining lives of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 63 and 64 days, respectively.Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by the third-party client seller, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of A or 159above, based on Citi&#8217;s internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific credit enhancements, the conduits, other than the government-guaranteed loan conduit, have obtained letters of credit from the Company, which equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit&#8217;s assets with a minimum of $350 million. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately $1.9&#160;billion and $1.9 billion as of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively. The net result across multiseller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancements described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial paper investors.At March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, the Company owned $8.5&#160;billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The Company&#8217;s investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits.Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) TrustsAt March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the Company.At March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $0.9&#160;billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of which $0.6&#160;billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, were offset by reimbursement agreements. For the remaining exposure related to TOB transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was at least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the transaction, no reimbursement agreement was executed.The Company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not variable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled $1.4&#160;billion and $1.4 billion as of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.Asset-Based FinancingThe primary types of Citi&#8217;s asset-based financings, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss are shown below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.March 31, 2023December 31, 2022In millions of dollarsTotal unconsolidated VIE assetsMaximum exposure to unconsolidated VIEsTotal unconsolidated VIE assetsMaximum exposure to unconsolidated VIEsTypeCommercial and other real estate$44,631&#160;$9,175&#160;$43,236&#160;$8,806&#160;Corporate loans24,257&#160;15,332&#160;23,120&#160;15,077&#160;Other (including investment funds, airlines and shipping)99,237&#160;27,481&#160;166,320&#160;27,986&#160;Total$168,125&#160;$51,988&#160;$232,676&#160;$51,869&#160;16020.&#160;&#160;DERIVATIVESIn the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions. All derivatives are recorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information regarding Citi&#8217;s use of and accounting for derivatives, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.Information pertaining to Citigroup&#8217;s derivatives activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of Citi&#8217;s exposure to derivative transactions. Citi&#8217;s derivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions. Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk. In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on Citi&#8217;s market share, levels of client activity and other factors.

These arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of overall risk.161The following tables present the gross and net fair values of the Company&#8217;s derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022. Gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements. Under ASC&#160;815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral.In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also record a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset, such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained.162Derivative Mark-to-Market (MTM) Receivables/PayablesDerivatives classified in Trading account assets/liabilities(1)(2)In millions of dollars at March 31, 2023AssetsLiabilitiesDerivatives instruments designated as ASC&#160;815 hedgesOver-the-counter$496&#160;$&#8212;&#160;Cleared104&#160;35&#160;Interest rate contracts$600&#160;$35&#160;Over-the-counter$1,491&#160;$1,028&#160;Cleared2&#160;18&#160;Foreign exchange contracts$1,493&#160;$1,046&#160;Total derivatives instruments designated as ASC&#160;815 hedges$2,093&#160;$1,081&#160;Derivatives instruments not designated as ASC&#160;815 hedgesOver-the-counter$122,577&#160;$114,593&#160;Cleared44,236&#160;48,255&#160;Exchange traded218&#160;160&#160;Interest rate contracts$167,031&#160;$163,008&#160;Over-the-counter$129,761&#160;$127,318&#160;Cleared359&#160;364&#160;Exchange traded1&#160;4&#160;Foreign exchange contracts$130,121&#160;$127,686&#160;Over-the-counter$16,295&#160;$21,467&#160;Cleared&#8212;&#160;6&#160;Exchange traded24,210&#160;23,126&#160;Equity contracts$40,505&#160;$44,599&#160;Over-the-counter$23,115&#160;$22,329&#160;Exchange traded1,067&#160;1,246&#160;Commodity and other contracts$24,182&#160;$23,575&#160;Over-the-counter$6,977&#160;$6,868&#160;Cleared3,065&#160;3,147&#160;Credit derivatives$10,042&#160;$10,015&#160;Total derivatives instruments not designated as ASC&#160;815 hedges$371,881&#160;$368,883&#160;Total derivatives$373,974&#160;$369,964&#160;Less: Netting agreements(3)$(292,519)$(292,519)Less: Netting cash collateral received/paid(4)(15,376)(23,990)Net receivables/payables included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet(5)$66,079&#160;$53,455&#160;Additional amounts subject to an enforceable master netting agreement, but not offset on the Consolidated Balance SheetLess: Cash collateral received/paid$(1,094)$(781)Less: Non-cash collateral received/paid(4,657)(12,984)Total net receivables/payables(5)$60,328&#160;$39,690&#160;(1)The derivative fair values are also presented in Note 21.

Citigroup presents this disclosure by business classification, showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to non-derivative instruments within the same trading portfolios, as this represents how these portfolios are risk managed. See Note 6 for further information. The amounts recognized in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income related to derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are shown below. The table below does not include any offsetting gains (losses) on the economically hedged items to the extent that such amounts are also recorded in Other revenue.&#160;Gains (losses) included in Other revenueThree Months Ended March 31,In millions of dollars20232022Interest rate contracts$(96)$72&#160;Foreign exchange26&#160;(77)Total$(70)$(5)Fair Value HedgesHedging of Benchmark Interest Rate RiskCitigroup&#8217;s fair value hedges, which include hedges of closed pools of assets, are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt securities or loans.For qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are presented within Interest revenue or Interest expense based on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability. Hedging of Foreign Exchange RiskCitigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale debt securities and long-term debt that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities or issuing the debt. The hedging instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange contract or a cross-currency swap contract. Changes in the fair value of the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) of forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Citi also excludes changes in the fair value of cross-currency basis associated with cross-currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records them in Other comprehensive income.Hedging of Commodity Price RiskCitigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price movements in physical commodities inventories. The hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying commodity. In this hedge, the change in the carrying value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets the change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in earnings. Although the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings, under certain hedge programs, Citigroup excludes changes in the fair value of the forward points (i.e., spot-forward difference) of the futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and they are generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Under other hedge programs, Citi excludes changes in the fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records them in Other comprehensive income.165The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Company&#8217;s fair value hedges: &#160;Gains (losses) on fair value hedges(1)Three Months Ended March 31,20232022In millions of dollarsOther revenueNet interest incomeOther revenueNet interest incomeGain (loss) on the hedging derivatives included in assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedgesInterest rate hedges$&#8212;&#160;$(1)$&#8212;&#160;$(4,666)Foreign exchange hedges548&#160;&#8212;&#160;(425)&#8212;&#160;Commodity hedges(4)(508)&#8212;&#160;872&#160;&#8212;&#160;Total gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives included in assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges$40&#160;$(1)$447&#160;$(4,666)Gain (loss) on the hedged item in designated and qualifying fair value hedgesInterest rate hedges$&#8212;&#160;$(7)$&#8212;&#160;$4,597&#160;Foreign exchange hedges(548)&#8212;&#160;424&#160;&#8212;&#160;Commodity hedges(4)508&#160;&#8212;&#160;(872)&#8212;&#160;Total gain (loss) on the hedged item in designated and qualifying fair value hedges$(40)$(7)$(448)$4,597&#160;Net gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives excluded from assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges&#160;Interest rate hedges$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$(6)Foreign exchange hedges(2)22&#160;&#8212;&#160;31&#160;&#8212;&#160;Commodity hedges(3)(4)49&#160;&#8212;&#160;49&#160;&#8212;&#160;Total net gain (loss) on the hedging derivatives excluded from assessment of the effectiveness of fair value hedges$71&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$80&#160;$(6)(1)Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are included in Interest income/Interest expense. The accrued interest income on fair value hedges is recorded in Net interest income and is excluded from this table. Amounts included both hedges of AFS securities and long term debt on a net basis which largely offset in the current period.(2)Amounts related to the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings under the mark-to-market approach. Amounts related to cross-currency basis, which are recognized in AOCI, are not reflected in the table above. The amount of cross-currency basis included in AOCI was $(26)&#160;million and $64&#160;million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.(3)Amounts related to the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness reflected directly in earnings under the mark-to-market approach or recorded in AOCI under the amortization approach. The quarter ended March 31, 2023 includes gain (loss) of approximately $45&#160;million and $4&#160;million under the mark-to-market approach and amortization approach, respectively. The quarter ended March 31, 2022 includes gain (loss) of approximately $50&#160;million and $(1)&#160;million under the mark-to-market approach and amortization approach, respectively.(4)The gain (loss) amounts for commodity hedges are included in Principal transactions for periods beginning 2023.166Cumulative Basis Adjustment Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative changes in the hedged risk.&#160;This cumulative basis adjustment becomes part of the carrying amount of the hedged item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of Citi&#8217;s hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, along with the cumulative basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those hedged assets and liabilities that would reverse through earnings in future periods.In millions of dollarsBalance sheet line item in which hedged item is recordedCarrying amount of hedged asset/ liabilityCumulative basis adjustment increasing (decreasing) the carrying amountActiveDe-designatedAs of March 31, 2023Debt securities AFS(1)(3)$90,947&#160;$(2,079)$(320)Long-term debt135,571&#160;(2,928)(4,493)As of December 31, 2022Debt securities AFS(2)(3)$98,837&#160;$(2,976)$(333)Long-term debt144,549&#160;(5,040)(3,399)(1)These amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of less than $(1) million for active hedges and $(295) million for de-designated hedges as of March&#160;31, 2023, related to certain financial assets previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the portfolio layer approach. The Company designated approximately $7&#160;billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of financial assets with a carrying value of $14&#160;billion as of March&#160;31, 2023) in a portfolio layer hedging relationship.(2)These amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of $(91) million for active hedges and $(309) million for de-designated hedges as of December&#160;31, 2022, related to certain prepayable financial assets previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the last-of-layer approach. The Company designated approximately $3 billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets with a carrying value of $11 billion as of December&#160;31, 2022) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship.(3)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost.167Cash Flow HedgesCitigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted transactions. These cash flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis.For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. The net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12&#160;months of March&#160;31, 2023 is approximately $(1.4)&#160;billion. The maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 13 years.The pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below. The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is shown in Note&#160;18.&#160;Three Months Ended March 31,In millions of dollars20232022Amount of gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on derivativesInterest rate contracts$21&#160;$(1,760)Foreign exchange contracts(12)23&#160;Total gain (loss) recognized in AOCI$9&#160;$(1,737)Other revenueNet interest incomeOther revenueNet interest incomeAmount of gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI to earnings(1)Interest rate contracts$&#8212;&#160;$(469)$&#8212;&#160;$286&#160;Foreign exchange contracts(1)&#8212;&#160;(1)&#8212;&#160;Total gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings$(1)$(469)$(1)$286&#160;Net pretax change in cash flow hedges included within AOCI$479&#160;$(2,022)(1)All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate contracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net interest income). For all other hedges, the amounts reclassified to earnings are included primarily in Other revenue and Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.168Net Investment Hedges Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with Citigroup&#8217;s equity investments in several non-U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi records the change in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the translation adjustment for the investments in these foreign subsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI.The pretax gain (loss) recorded in CTA within AOCI, related to net investment hedges, was $(676)&#160;million and $(195)&#160;million for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.Credit DerivativesThe following tables summarize the key characteristics of Citi&#8217;s credit derivatives portfolio by counterparty and derivative form:Fair valuesNotionalsIn millions of dollars at March&#160;31, 2023Receivable(1)Payable(2)ProtectionpurchasedProtectionsoldBy instrumentCredit default swaps and options$9,258&#160;$9,596&#160;$761,898&#160;$725,565&#160;Total return swaps and other784&#160;419&#160;19,934&#160;5,623&#160;Total by instrument$10,042&#160;$10,015&#160;$781,832&#160;$731,188&#160;By rating of reference entityInvestment grade$4,892&#160;$4,406&#160;$621,216&#160;$582,066&#160;Non-investment grade5,150&#160;5,609&#160;160,616&#160;149,122&#160;Total by rating of reference entity$10,042&#160;$10,015&#160;$781,832&#160;$731,188&#160;By maturityWithin 1&#160;year$1,007&#160;$1,650&#160;$167,412&#160;$167,358&#160;From 1 to 5&#160;years6,146&#160;5,885&#160;509,256&#160;476,327&#160;After 5&#160;years2,889&#160;2,480&#160;105,164&#160;87,503&#160;Total by maturity$10,042&#160;$10,015&#160;$781,832&#160;$731,188&#160;(1)The fair value amount receivable is composed of $4,849&#160;million under protection purchased and $5,193&#160;million under protection sold.(2)The fair value amount payable is composed of $5,680&#160;million under protection purchased and $4,335&#160;million under protection sold.&#160;Fair valuesNotionalsIn millions of dollars at December&#160;31, 2022Receivable(1)Payable(2)ProtectionpurchasedProtectionsoldBy instrumentCredit default swaps and options$6,867&#160;$7,360&#160;$623,981&#160;$586,504&#160;Total return swaps and other1,522&#160;417&#160;17,658&#160;6,632&#160;Total by instrument$8,389&#160;$7,777&#160;$641,639&#160;$593,136&#160;By rating of reference entityInvestment grade$3,796&#160;$2,970&#160;$499,339&#160;$462,873&#160;Non-investment grade4,593&#160;4,807&#160;142,300&#160;130,263&#160;Total by rating of reference entity$8,389&#160;$7,777&#160;$641,639&#160;$593,136&#160;By maturityWithin 1&#160;year$1,753&#160;$1,801&#160;$147,031&#160;$148,721&#160;From 1 to 5&#160;years4,577&#160;4,134&#160;443,113&#160;407,293&#160;After 5&#160;years2,059&#160;1,842&#160;51,495&#160;37,122&#160;Total by maturity$8,389&#160;$7,777&#160;$641,639&#160;$593,136&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fair value amount receivable is composed of $5,094 million under protection purchased and $3,295 million under protection sold.(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fair value amount payable is composed of $3,573 million under protection purchased and $4,204 million under protection sold.169Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in DerivativesCertain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the Company. These events, which are defined by the existing derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and its affiliates.The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022 was $14&#160;billion and $18 billion, respectively. The Company posted $12 billion and $15 billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively.A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies as of March&#160;31, 2023, the Company could be required to post an additional $0.6&#160;billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of $22&#160;million upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.6&#160;billion.Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the Company, and for which the Company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still outstanding), the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were $0.6&#160;billion and $1.4 billion as of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively.At March&#160;31, 2023, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $0.6&#160;billion. The fair value of the total return swaps as of March&#160;31, 2023 was $14&#160;million recorded as gross derivative assets and $2&#160;million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December&#160;31, 2022, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $1.4 billion, and the fair value of the total return swaps was $27 million recorded as gross derivative assets and $32 million recorded as gross derivative liabilities.The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis, before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.17021.&#160;&#160;FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTFor additional information regarding fair value measurement at Citi, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.Fair Value HierarchyASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company&#8217;s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:&#8226;Level&#160;1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.&#8226;Level&#160;2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in the market.&#8226;Level&#160;3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The fair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes rules-based and data-driven selection criteria to determine whether an instrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3:&#8226;The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an active market and therefore considered a Level 1 instrument is based upon the frequency of observed transactions and the quality of independent market data available on the measurement date. &#8226;A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is observability of prices/market inputs to models, or where any unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation. The determination of whether an input is considered observable is based on the availability of independent market data and its corroboration, for example through observed transactions in the market.&#8226;Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.Market Valuation AdjustmentsThe table below summarizes the credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) applied to the fair value of derivative instruments at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022:&#160;Credit and funding valuation adjustmentscontra-liability (contra-asset)In millions of dollarsMarch 31,2023December 31,2022Counterparty CVA$(771)$(816)Asset FVA(593)(622)Citigroup (own credit) CVA564&#160;607&#160;Liability FVA235&#160;263&#160;Total CVA and FVA&#8212;derivative instruments$(565)$(568) The table below summarizes pretax gains (losses) related to changes in CVA on derivative instruments, net of hedges, FVA on derivatives and debt valuation adjustments (DVA) on Citi&#8217;s own fair value option (FVO) liabilities for the periods indicated:&#160;Credit/funding/debt valuationadjustments gain (loss)Three Months Ended March 31,In millions of dollars20232022Counterparty CVA$(34)$(107)Asset FVA(6)(105)Own credit CVA(35)116&#160;Liability FVA(28)22&#160;Total CVA and FVA&#8212;derivative instruments$(103)$(74)DVA related to own FVO liabilities(1)$(433)$1,050&#160;Total CVA, DVA and FVA$(536)$976&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 171 Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022. The Company may hedge positions that have been classified in the Level&#160;3 category with other financial instruments (hedging instruments) that may be classified as Level&#160;3, but also with financial instruments classified as Level&#160;1 or Level&#160;2.

(2)Unrealized gains (losses) on MSRs are recorded in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.(3)Represents the amount of total gains or losses for the period, included in earnings (and AOCI for changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities and DVA on fair value option liabilities), attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets and liabilities classified as Level&#160;3 that are still held at March&#160;31, 2022.(4)Total Level&#160;3 trading derivative assets and liabilities have been netted in these tables for presentation purposes only.Level&#160;3 Fair Value Transfers The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December&#160;31, 2022 to March&#160;31, 2023:&#8226;During the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023, transfers of Long-term debt were $1.1&#160;billion from Level 2 to Level 3. Of the $1.1&#160;billion transfer, approximately $1.0&#160;billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $0.1&#160;billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $4.8&#160;billion of certain structured long-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023.The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period December&#160;31, 2021 to March&#160;31, 2022:&#8226;During the three months ended March&#160;31, 2022, transfers of Long-term debt were $3.4&#160;billion from Level 2 to Level 3. Of the $3.4&#160;billion transfer, approximately $2.9&#160;billion related to interest option volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $0.5&#160;billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money).

These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value.The following tables present the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded:In millions of dollarsFair valueLevel&#160;2Level&#160;3March 31, 2023&#160;&#160;&#160;Loans HFS(1)$3,926&#160;$2,544&#160;$1,382&#160;Other real estate owned5&#160;&#8212;&#160;5&#160;Loans(2)56&#160;&#8212;&#160;56&#160;Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative158&#160;&#8212;&#160;158&#160;Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis$4,145&#160;$2,544&#160;$1,601&#160;In millions of dollarsFair valueLevel&#160;2Level&#160;3December 31, 2022&#160;&#160;&#160;Loans HFS(1)$2,336&#160;$457&#160;$1,879&#160;Other real estate owned1&#160;&#8212;&#160;1&#160;Loans(2)69&#160;&#8212;&#160;69&#160;Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative597&#160;&#8212;&#160;597&#160;Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis$3,003&#160;$457&#160;$2,546&#160;(1)Net of mark-to-market amounts on the unfunded portion of loans HFS recognized as Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.(2)Represents impaired loans held for investment whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, primarily real estate.183Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level&#160;3 Nonrecurring Fair Value MeasurementsThe following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of Level&#160;3 nonrecurring fair value measurements and the most significant unobservable inputs used in those measurements:As of March 31, 2023Fair&#160;value(1)(in&#160;millions)MethodologyInputLow(2)HighWeightedaverage(3)Loans HFS$1,382&#160;Price-basedPrice$75.00&#160;$104.48&#160;$91.79&#160;Other real estate owned$4&#160;Price-basedAppraised value(4)$18,899&#160;$729,000&#160;$367,017&#160;Price$100&#160;$100&#160;$100&#160;Loans(5)$32&#160;Recovery analysisAppraised value(4)$12,000&#160;$24,592,081&#160;$10,920,430&#160;25&#160;Price-basedNon-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative$122&#160;Price-basedPrice$4.02&#160;$1,912.00&#160;$1,183.00&#160;35&#160;Comparable analysisRevenue multiple5.20x21.90x13.00xAs of December 31, 2022Fair&#160;value(1)(in&#160;millions)MethodologyInputLow(2)HighWeightedaverage(3)Loans HFS$1,830&#160;Price-basedPrice$0.88&#160;$100.23&#160;$65.91&#160;Other real estate owned$1&#160;Price-basedAppraised value(4)$30,000&#160;$441,750&#160;$310,552&#160;Loans(5)$45&#160;Recovery analysis Appraised value(4)$12,000&#160;$14,022,820&#160;$3,714,342&#160;$24&#160;Appraised valueNon-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative$234&#160;Comparable analysisRevenue multiple 4.95x73.10x19.68x363&#160;Price-basedPrice$0.46&#160;$2,416.43&#160;$557.86&#160;(1)The tables above include the fair values for the items listed and may not foot to the total population for each category.(2)Some inputs are shown as zero due to rounding.(3)Weighted averages are calculated based on the fair values of the instruments.(4)Appraised values are disclosed in whole dollars.(5)Represents impaired loans held for investment whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, primarily real estate.Nonrecurring Fair Value ChangesThe following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that were still held:Three Months Ended March 31,In millions of dollars20232022Loans HFS$(56)$(152)Other real estate owned&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Loans(1)(2)4&#160;Non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative(25)85&#160;Total nonrecurring fair value gains (losses)$(83)$(63)(1)Represents loans held for investment whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, primarily real estate.184Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value The following tables present the carrying value and fair value of Citigroup&#8217;s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value.

In addition, the carrying values exclude $0.3&#160;billion and $0.4 billion of lease finance receivables at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively.(2)Includes items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.(3)Includes cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables, reinsurance recoverables and other financial instruments included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.(4)The carrying value includes long-term debt balances under qualifying fair value hedges.(5)Includes brokerage payables, separate and variable accounts, short-term borrowings (carried at cost) and other financial instruments included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.The estimated fair values of the Company&#8217;s corporate unfunded lending commitments at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022 were off-balance sheet liabilities of $7.3&#160;billion and $13.7 billion, respectively, substantially all of which are classified as Level&#160;3. The Company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower.18522.&#160;&#160;FAIR VALUE ELECTIONSThe Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI. The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note&#160;19 for additional details on Citi&#8217;s MSRs. Additional discussion regarding other applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 21.The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:Changes in fair value&#8212;gains (losses)&#160;Three Months Ended March 31,In millions of dollars20232022AssetsSecurities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell$85&#160;$(62)Trading account assets61&#160;(61)LoansCertain corporate loans(309)(332)Certain consumer loans5&#160;(1)Total loans$(304)$(333)Other assetsMSRs$(3)$98&#160;Certain mortgage loans HFS(1)8&#160;(186)Total other assets$5&#160;$(88)Total assets$(153)$(544)LiabilitiesInterest-bearing deposits$(134)$45&#160;Securities loaned and sold under agreements to repurchase(68)77&#160;Trading account liabilities75&#160;(640)Short-term borrowings(2)(142)132&#160;Long-term debt(2)(4,349)6,071&#160;Total liabilities$(4,618)$5,685&#160;(1)Includes gains (losses) associated with interest rate lock commitments for originated loans for which the Company has elected the fair value option.(2)Includes DVA that is included in AOCI. See Notes 18 and 21.186Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi&#8217;s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using Citi&#8217;s credit spreads observed in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup&#8217;s own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI. See Note 18 for additional information.Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company&#8217;s credit spreads.The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company&#8217;s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss of $(433)&#160;million and gain of $1,050 million for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company&#8217;s current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesSelected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term BorrowingsThe Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions. The related interest revenue and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.Certain Loans and Other Credit ProductsCitigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup&#8217;s lending and trading businesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the Company.The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value:&#160;March 31, 2023December 31, 2022In millions of dollarsTrading assetsLoansTrading assetsLoansCarrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet$5,364&#160;$5,134&#160;$6,011&#160;$5,360&#160;Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value260&#160;125&#160;167&#160;51&#160;Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90&#160;days past due&#8212;&#160;2&#160;&#8212;&#160;2&#160;Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90&#160;days past due&#8212;&#160;1&#160;&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;187In addition to the amounts reported above, $641 million and $729 million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively.Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest revenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The changes in fair value for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023 and 2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a gain of $9&#160;million and a loss of $(59)&#160;million, respectively. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and recovery assumptions.Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious MetalsCitigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity and foreign currency trading activities or to economically hedge certain exposures from issuing structured liabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity forward derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the debt host contract within Trading account assets on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively. The amounts are expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in future periods.As part of its commodity and foreign currency trading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi&#8217;s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of March&#160;31, 2023, there were approximately $25.1&#160;billion and $17.2&#160;billion of notional amounts of such forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts outstanding, respectively. Changes in the fair values of these investments are recorded in Principal transactions in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Income.Certain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate VenturesCitigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option for certain of these ventures, because such investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund activities in Citi&#8217;s investment companies, which are reported at fair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments (debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are classified as Investments on Citigroup&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet.Changes in the fair values of these investments are classified in Other revenue in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Income.Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications.The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value:In millions of dollarsMarch 31,2023December 31, 2022Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet$901&#160;$793&#160;Aggregate fair value in excess of (less than) unpaid principal balance6&#160;(10)Balance of non-accrual loans or loans more than 90&#160;days past due1&#160;1&#160;Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90&#160;days past due&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;188The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in Other revenue in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value during the three months ended March&#160;31, 2023 and 2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in addition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.Certain Debt LiabilitiesThe Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt liabilities, because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These positions are classified as Long-term debt on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet.The following table provides information about the carrying value of notes carried at fair value, disaggregated by type of risk:In billions of dollarsMarch 31, 2023December 31, 2022Interest rate linked$57.3&#160;$53.4&#160;Foreign exchange linked0.1&#160;0.1&#160;Equity linked47.7&#160;42.5&#160;Commodity linked5.0&#160;5.0&#160;Credit linked5.1&#160;5.0&#160;Total$115.2&#160;$106.0&#160;The portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in Citigroup&#8217;s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all other changes in fair value are reported in Principal transactions. Changes in the fair value of these liabilities include accrued interest, which is also included in the change in fair value reported in Principal transactions.The following table provides information about long-term debt carried at fair value:In millions of dollarsMarch 31, 2023December 31, 2022Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet$115,168&#160;$105,995&#160;Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value(3,146)(2,944)The following table provides information about short-term borrowings carried at fair value:In millions of dollarsMarch 31, 2023December 31, 2022Carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet$6,873&#160;$6,222&#160;Aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of (less than) fair value(10)(9)18923.&#160; GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTSCiti provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide range of business transactions. For certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.In addition, the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees. For additional information regarding Citi&#8217;s guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables below, as well as its other guarantees and indemnifications excluded from these tables, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.The following tables present information about Citi&#8217;s guarantees at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022:Maximum potential amount of future payments&#160;In billions of dollars at March 31, 2023Expire within1&#160;yearExpire after1&#160;yearTotal amountoutstandingCarrying value(in millions of dollars)Financial standby letters of credit$23.3&#160;$67.2&#160;$90.5&#160;$805&#160;Performance guarantees4.8&#160;5.7&#160;10.5&#160;52&#160;Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees22.9&#160;29.3&#160;52.2&#160;372&#160;Loans sold with recourse&#8212;&#160;1.7&#160;1.7&#160;13&#160;Securities lending indemnifications(1)108.7&#160;&#8212;&#160;108.7&#160;&#8212;&#160;Credit card merchant processing(2)121.7&#160;&#8212;&#160;121.7&#160;1&#160;Credit card arrangements with partners0.1&#160;0.4&#160;0.5&#160;7&#160;Other0.2&#160;8.4&#160;8.6&#160;41&#160;Total$281.7&#160;$112.7&#160;$394.4&#160;$1,291&#160;&#160;Maximum potential amount of future payments&#160;In billions of dollars at December 31, 2022Expire within1&#160;yearExpire after1&#160;yearTotal amountoutstandingCarrying value(in millions of dollars)Financial standby letters of credit$31.3&#160;$58.3&#160;$89.6&#160;$905&#160;Performance guarantees6.1&#160;5.6&#160;11.7&#160;65&#160;Derivative instruments considered to be guarantees18.5&#160;30.0&#160;48.5&#160;353&#160;Loans sold with recourse&#8212;&#160;1.7&#160;1.7&#160;13&#160;Securities lending indemnifications(1)95.9&#160;&#8212;&#160;95.9&#160;&#8212;&#160;Credit card merchant processing(2)129.6&#160;&#8212;&#160;129.6&#160;1&#160;Credit card arrangements with partners&#8212;&#160;0.6&#160;0.6&#160;7&#160;Other0.1&#160;8.4&#160;8.5&#160;32&#160;Total$281.5&#160;$104.6&#160;$386.1&#160;$1,376&#160;(1)The carrying values of securities lending indemnifications were not material for either period presented, as the probability of potential liabilities arising from these guarantees is minimal.(2)At March&#160;31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be approximately $122 billion and $130&#160;billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.190Loans Sold with RecourseLoans sold with recourse represent Citi&#8217;s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales agreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the buyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any loans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown in the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding residential mortgage representation and warranty claims related to its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies and, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase reserve was approximately $10&#160;million and $10&#160;million at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Credit Card Arrangements with PartnersCiti, in one of its credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of certain customer originations during the term of the agreement. To the extent that such origination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would have been generated in connection with such originations. Other Guarantees and IndemnificationsCredit Card Protection ProgramsCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products, including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products, price protection for certain purchases and protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and Citi&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The protection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience. At March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, the actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of Citi&#8217;s obligations related to these programs were immaterial.Value-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing Houses) (VTNs)Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a condition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization due to another member&#8217;s default on its obligations. Citi&#8217;s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN&#8217;s funds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share. The maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would require an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred; however, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi&#8217;s participation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables above, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March&#160;31, 2023 or December&#160;31, 2022 for potential obligations that could arise from Citi&#8217;s involvement with VTN associations.Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance IndemnificationCiti has an indemnification contingency to Brighthouse Financial in connection with Citi&#8217;s sale of an insurance subsidiary. A liability under this indemnification agreement is currently remote because Brighthouse Financial would become responsible for LTC policyholder claims only when both the reinsurance provided by other parties ceases and trust assets set aside to meet these claims are not adequate. However, should events occur causing both the reinsurance protection and trust collateral to become insufficient to cover Brighthouse Financial&#8217;s LTC policyholder claims, Citi will be required to either estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of loss to the extent that such an estimate can be made, or to accrue for such liability if the event becomes probable and estimable. Citi continues to closely monitor its potential exposure under this indemnification obligation. For additional information, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives ClearingCiti provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 20 for a discussion of Citi&#8217;s derivatives activities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial Statements.As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the respective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers.There are two types of margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and due from banks, respectively. However, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control the client cash balances, the client cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass 191through to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository institutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the depository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are legally isolated from Citi&#8217;s bankruptcy estate. The total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately $19.2 billion and $18.0&#160;billion as of March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively.Variation margin due from clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects changes in the value of the client&#8217;s derivative contracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of the client&#8217;s derivative contracts). In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the client&#8217;s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client, which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi&#8217;s credit risk in the event the client fails to perform.As required by ASC 860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on Citi&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet.Carrying Value&#8212;Guarantees and IndemnificationsAt March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in Other liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included in Other liabilities.CollateralCash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $52.6 billion and $51.8&#160;billion at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $71.9 billion and $63.7&#160;billion at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $3.2 billion and $3.7&#160;billion at March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, respectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined.192Performance RiskPresented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based on internal and external credit ratings. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees. &#160;Maximum potential amount of future paymentsIn billions of dollars at March 31, 2023InvestmentgradeNon-investmentgradeNotratedTotalFinancial standby letters of credit$78.0&#160;$10.2&#160;$2.3&#160;$90.5&#160;Loans sold with recourse&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;1.7&#160;1.7&#160;Credit card arrangements with partners&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;0.5&#160;0.5&#160;Other&#8212;&#160;8.6&#160;&#8212;&#160;8.6&#160;Total$78.0&#160;$18.8&#160;$4.5&#160;$101.3&#160;&#160;Maximum potential amount of future paymentsIn billions of dollars at December 31, 2022InvestmentgradeNon-investmentgradeNotratedTotalFinancial standby letters of credit$77.9&#160;$10.4&#160;$1.3&#160;$89.6&#160;Loans sold with recourse&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;1.7&#160;1.7&#160;Credit card arrangements with partners&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;0.6&#160;0.6&#160;Other&#8212;&#160;8.5&#160;&#8212;&#160;8.5&#160;Total$77.9&#160;$18.9&#160;$3.6&#160;$100.4&#160;193Credit Commitments and Lines of CreditThe table below summarizes Citigroup&#8217;s credit commitments:In&#160;millions&#160;of&#160;dollarsU.S.Outside of&#160;U.S.(1)March 31,2023December 31, 2022Commercial and similar letters of credit $663&#160;$5,333&#160;$5,996&#160;$5,316&#160;One- to four-family residential mortgages1,200&#160;1,179&#160;2,379&#160;2,394&#160;Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties5,772&#160;686&#160;6,458&#160;6,380&#160;Commercial real estate, construction and land development12,552&#160;1,602&#160;14,154&#160;15,170&#160;Credit card lines612,236&#160;76,103&#160;688,339&#160;683,232&#160;Commercial and other consumer loan commitments187,295&#160;106,002&#160;293,297&#160;297,399&#160;Other commitments and contingencies5,312&#160;178&#160;5,490&#160;5,673&#160;Total$825,030&#160;$191,083&#160;$1,016,113&#160;$1,015,564&#160;(1)Consumer commitments related to the business HFS countries under sales agreements are reflected in their original categories until the respective sales are completed.The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period.Other Commitments and ContingenciesOther commitments and contingencies include all other transactions related to commitments and contingencies not reported on the lines above.Unsettled Reverse Repurchase and Securities Borrowing Agreements and Unsettled Repurchase and Securities Lending AgreementsIn addition, in the normal course of business, Citigroup enters into reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements, which settle at a future date. At March&#160;31, 2023 and December&#160;31, 2022, Citigroup had approximately $138.0&#160;billion and $111.6&#160;billion of unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, and approximately $75.5&#160;billion and $37.3&#160;billion of unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements, respectively. See Note 10 for a further discussion of securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned, including the Company&#8217;s policy for offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.Restricted CashCitigroup defines restricted cash (as cash subject to withdrawal restrictions) to include cash deposited with central banks that must be maintained to meet minimum regulatory requirements, and cash set aside for the benefit of customers or for other purposes such as compensating balance arrangements or debt retirement. Restricted cash may include minimum reserve requirements at certain central banks and cash segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of customer assets as required by Citigroup broker-dealers&#8217; primary regulators, including the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom&#8217;s Prudential Regulation Authority.Restricted cash is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within the following balance sheet lines:In&#160;millions&#160;of&#160;dollarsMarch 31,2023December 31, 2022Cash and due from banks$4,211&#160;$4,820&#160;Deposits with banks, net of allowance12,394&#160;12,156&#160;Total$16,605&#160;$16,976&#160;In addition to the restricted cash amounts shown above, at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, approximately $2.7 billion and $1.8&#160;billion were held at the Russia National Settlements Depository and subject to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. This restricted amount is reported within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.194 24.&#160; LEASESThe Company&#8217;s operating leases, where Citi is a lessee, include real estate, such as office space and branches, and various types of equipment. These leases may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features; however, these options do not impact the lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise options. These leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately six years as of March&#160;31, 2023. For additional information regarding Citi&#8217;s leases, see Notes 1 and 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. The following table presents information on the right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liabilities included in Premises and equipment and Other liabilities, respectively:In millions of dollarsMarch 31,2023December 31,2022ROU asset$2,855&#160;$2,892&#160;Lease liability3,029&#160;3,076&#160;The Company recognizes fixed lease costs on a straight-line basis throughout the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.195 25.&#160;&#160;CONTINGENCIESThe following information supplements and amends, as applicable, the disclosure in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. For purposes of this Note, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers, directors, and employees, are sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties.In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies, including any litigation, regulatory, or tax matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters. With respect to previously incurred loss contingencies for which recovery is expected, Citi applies loss recovery accounting when disputes and uncertainties affecting recognition are resolved.If Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because the matter does not meet the criteria for accrual (as set forth above), or Citigroup believes an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued for a particular matter, in each case assuming a material loss is reasonably possible but not probable, Citigroup discloses the matter. In addition, for such matters, Citigroup discloses an estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued for those matters for which an estimate can be made. At March 31, 2023, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately $1.2&#160;billion in the aggregate.As available information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation, regulatory, tax, or other matters are subject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of making an estimate, Citigroup may only have preliminary or incomplete information about the facts underlying the claim; its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators, or tax authorities may prove to be wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimates because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all these reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued in relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate.Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup&#8217;s management, based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current accruals, that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup&#8217;s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.For further information on ASC 450 and Citigroup&#8217;s accounting and disclosure framework for contingencies, including for any litigation, regulatory, and tax matters disclosed herein, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K.FDIC Special AssessmentOn April 18, 2023, the FDIC announced that in May 2023, it will propose a special assessment to recover the uninsured deposit losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. On May 1, 2023, the FDIC announced that its Deposit Insurance Fund will incur additional costs related to the resolution of First Republic Bank. Citibank, N.A. could incur an increase in its non-interest expense from the imposition of additional assessments by the FDIC. However, neither the amount nor the timing of any additional costs can be reasonably estimated.
