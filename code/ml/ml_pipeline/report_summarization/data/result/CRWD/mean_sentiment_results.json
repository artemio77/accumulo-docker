        "449": "in addition , because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks and endpoints change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target , there is a risk that an advanced attack could emerge that our cloud native security platform is unable to detect or prevent until after some of our customers are affected .",
        "450": "additionally , our falcon platform may falsely indicate a cyberattack or threat that does not actually exist , which may lessen customers & # 8217 ; trust in our solutions . moreover , as our cloud native security platform is adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and governments , individuals and organizations behind advanced cyberattacks may intensify their efforts to defeat our security platform .",
        "451": "if this happens , our systems and subscription customers could be specifically targeted by attackers and could result in vulnerabilities in our platform or undermine the market acceptance of our falcon platform and could adversely affect our reputation as a provider of security solutions .",

        "453": "further , if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another next - generation or cloud - based security system , our customers and potential customers may lose trust in cloud solutions generally , and cloud - based security solutions such as ours in particular . organizations are increasingly subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks , systems , and endpoints .",
        "454": "no security solution , including our falcon platform , can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network or otherwise perpetrating a security incident .",

        "458": "our falcon platform may fail to detect or prevent malware , viruses , worms or similar threats for any number of reasons , including our failure to enhance and expand our falcon platform to reflect the increasing sophistication of malware , viruses and other threats .",
        "459": "real or perceived security breaches of our customers & # 8217 ; networks could cause disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences and could result in negative publicity to us , damage to our reputation , and other customer relations issues , and may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations . as a cybersecurity provider , we have been , and expect to continue to be , a target of cyberattacks .",

        "461": "in particular , because we have been involved in the identification of organized cybercriminals and nation - state actors , we have been the subject of intense efforts by sophisticated cyber adversaries who seek to compromise our systems .",

        "466": "a successful attack or other incident that results in an interruption of service or that compromises our or our service providers & # 8217 ; internal networks , systems , or data could have a significant negative effect on our operations , reputation , financial resources , and the value of our intellectual property .",
        "467": "we cannot assure you that any of our efforts to manage this risk , including adoption of a comprehensive incident response plan and process for detecting , mitigating , and investigating security incidents that we regularly test through table - top exercises , testing of our security protocols through additional techniques , such as penetration testing , debriefing after security incidents , to improve our security and responses , and regular briefing of our directors and officers on our cybersecurity risks , preparedness , and management , will be effective in protecting us from such attacks . it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate the risk of such attacks , compromises , interruptions in service , or other security incidents affecting our internal systems or data , or that of our third - party service providers and vendors .",
        "468": "organizations are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their supply chain , networks , systems , and endpoints , and techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently .",

        "481": "the occurrence of any of these factors , or if we are unable to rapidly and cost - effectively fix such errors or other problems that may be identified , could damage our reputation , negatively affect our relationship with our customers or otherwise harm our business , results of operations and financial condition . we rely on our key technical , sales and management personnel to grow our business , and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business . our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract , retain , and motivate the members of our management team and other key employees throughout our organization .",
        "482": "in particular , we are highly dependent on the services of george kurtz , our president and chief executive officer , who is critical to our future vision and strategic direction .",

        "485": "leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage .",
        "486": "in particular , they can cause operational and administrative inefficiencies , and could impact relationships with key customers and vendors .",
        "487": "kurtz , or one or more of our key employees , or members of our management team resigns or otherwise ceases to provide us with their service , our business could be harmed . if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel , our business could be harmed . there is also significant competition for personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require across our technology , cyber , sales , professional services , and administrative support functions .",
        "488": "competition for these personnel is intense , especially for experienced sales professionals and for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud applications and security software .",
        "489": "we have from time to time experienced , and we expect to continue to experience , difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications .",
        "490": "for example , in recent years , recruiting , hiring and retaining employees with expertise in the cybersecurity industry has become increasingly difficult as the demand for cybersecurity professionals has increased as a result of the recent cybersecurity attacks on global corporations and governments .",
        "491": "additionally , our incident response and proactive services team is small and comprised of personnel with highly technical skills and experience , who are in high demand , and who would be difficult to replace .",
        "492": "more generally , the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing , developing and managing software and internet - related services .",
        "493": "many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have .",
        "494": "our competitors also may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees , and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis , on competitive terms , or at all .",
        "495": "we have in the past , and may in the future , be subject to allegations that employees we hire have been improperly solicited , or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees & # 8217 ; inventions or other work product , or that they have been hired in violation of non - compete provisions or non - solicitation provisions . in addition , job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment .",
        "496": "volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees .",
        "497": "also , many of our employees have become , or will soon become , vested in a substantial amount of equity awards , which may give them a substantial amount of personal wealth .",
        "498": "this may make it more difficult for us to retain and motivate these employees , and this wealth could affect their decision about whether or not they continue to work for us .",
        "499": "any failure to successfully attract , integrate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could adversely affect our business , results of operations and financial condition . if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force , we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers , and our business will be adversely affected . we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new customers and increase sales with existing customers .",
        "500": "our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend , in large part , on our success in recruiting , training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel , particularly in international markets .",

        "504": "our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect , and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business .",
        "505": "in addition , a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company and selling our solutions , and therefore this team may be less effective than our more seasoned sales personnel .",
        "506": "furthermore , hiring sales personnel in new countries , or expanding our existing presence , requires upfront and ongoing expenditures that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity .",
        "507": "we cannot predict whether , or to what extent , our sales will increase as we expand our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive .",
        "508": "if we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel , or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base , our business and results of operations will be adversely affected . because we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the term of the subscription , downturns or upturns in new business will not be immediately reflected in our results of operations . we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription , which is generally one year .",
        "509": "as a result , a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each period is attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements that we entered into during previous periods .",
        "510": "consequently , any increase or decline in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period .",
        "511": "any such change , however , would affect our revenue in future periods .",
        "512": "accordingly , the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods .",
        "513": "we may also be unable to timely reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales or renewals that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . our results of operations may fluctuate significantly , which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations . our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period , which could adversely affect our business , financial condition and results of operations .",
        "514": "our results of operations have varied significantly from period to period , and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary as a result of a number of factors , many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict , including : & # 8226 ; our ability to attract new and retain existing customers ; & # 8226 ; the budgeting cycles , seasonal buying patterns , and purchasing practices of customers ; & # 8226 ; economic difficulties confronting our customers , which may impact the number of modules or endpoint deployments they are willing or able to purchase ; & # 8226 ; the timing and length of our sales cycles ; & # 8226 ; changes in customer or channel partner requirements or market needs ; & # 8226 ; changes in the growth rate of the cloud - based saas - delivered endpoint security solutions market ; & # 8226 ; the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other competitive developments , including consolidation among our customers or competitors ; & # 8226 ; the level of awareness of cybersecurity threats , particularly advanced cyberattacks , and the market adoption of our falcon platform ; & # 8226 ; our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally ; & # 8226 ; decisions by organizations to purchase security solutions from larger , more established security vendors or from their primary it equipment vendors ; & # 8226 ; changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors ; table of contents & # 8226 ; any disruption in our relationship with channel partners ; & # 8226 ; insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our customers , affecting their ability to purchase or pay for our solutions ; & # 8226 ; significant security breaches of , technical difficulties with or interruptions to , the use of our falcon platform ; & # 8226 ; extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute - related settlement payments or outcomes ; & # 8226 ; future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices ; & # 8226 ; negative media coverage or publicity ; & # 8226 ; political events ; & # 8226 ; the amount and timing of operating costs ( including new hires ) and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business ; & # 8226 ; increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates ; and & # 8226 ; significant natural disasters and other catastrophic events , including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness , such",

        "517": "in addition , we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results as we typically receive a higher percentage of our annual orders from new customers , as well as renewal orders from existing customers , in the second half of the fiscal year as compared to the first half of the year due to the annual budget approval process of many of our customers .",

        "523": "the successful promotion of our crowdstrike and falcon brand will depend on a number of factors , including our marketing efforts , our ability to continue to develop additional cloud modules and features for our falcon platform , our ability to successfully differentiate our falcon platform from competitive cloud - based or legacy security solutions and , ultimately , our ability to detect and stop breaches .",
        "524": "although we believe it is important for our growth , our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue . in addition , independent industry or financial analysts and research firms often test our solutions and provide reviews of our falcon platform , as well as the products of our competitors , and perception of our falcon platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews .",
