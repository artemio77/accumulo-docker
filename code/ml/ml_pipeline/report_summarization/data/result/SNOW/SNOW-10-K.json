In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. You should not interpret our disclosure of any of the following risks to imply that such risks have not already materialized.&#8226;We have experienced rapid revenue growth, which may not be indicative of our future performance, and we have a limited operating history, both of which make it difficult to forecast our future results of operations.&#8226;We may not have visibility into our future financial position and results of operations.&#8226;We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.&#8226;General market conditions, volatility, or disruptions, including higher inflation, higher interest rates, bank failures, and fluctuations or volatility in capital markets or foreign currency exchange rates, could have an adverse impact on our or our customers&#8217; or partners&#8217; businesses, which could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.&#8226;The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.&#8226;If we fail to innovate in response to changing customer needs, new technologies, or other market requirements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.&#8226;If we or our third-party service providers experience an actual or perceived security breach or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our customers&#8217; data, our data, or our platform, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our platform may be reduced, and we may incur significant liabilities.&#8226;We could suffer disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform or with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which it relies.&#8226;We expect fluctuations in our financial results, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to our results of operations, our stock price could decline.&#8226;Failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and platform. &#8226;Sales efforts to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with respect to sales to smaller organizations.&#8226;Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy, or reductions in cloud spending or our customers&#8217; actual or anticipated consumption rates, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.6Table of ContentsPART IITEM 1. BUSINESSWe believe in a data connected world where organizations have seamless access to explore, share, and unlock the value of data. To realize this vision, we deliver the Data Cloud, a network where Snowflake customers, partners, developers, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways. Our platform is the innovative technology that powers the Data Cloud, enabling customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data applications, and share data and data products. We provide our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use. Snowflake solves the decades-old problem of data silos and data governance. Leveraging the elasticity and performance of the public cloud, our platform enables customers to unify and query data to support a wide variety of use cases. It also provides frictionless and governed data access so users can securely share data inside and outside of their organizations, generally without copying or moving the underlying data. As a result, customers can blend existing data with new data for broader context, augment data science efforts, and create new monetization streams. Delivered as a service, our platform requires near-zero maintenance, enabling customers to focus on deriving value from their data rather than managing infrastructure. Our cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable but logically integrated layers across compute, storage, and cloud services. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases with minimal latency. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data to create a unified data record. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case&#8217;s performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 38 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are generally interconnected to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a consistent, global user experience.Our platform supports a wide range of workloads that enable our customers&#8217; most important business objectives, including data warehousing, data lakes, and Unistore, as well as collaboration, data engineering, cybersecurity, data science and machine learning, and application development. From January 1, 2023 to January 31, 2023, we processed an average of approximately 2.6 billion daily queries across all our customer accounts, up from an average of approximately 1.5 billion daily queries during the corresponding month of the prior fiscal year. We are committed to expanding our platform&#8217;s use cases and supporting developers in building their applications and businesses. In 2021, we launched Snowpark for Java to allow developers to build in the language of their choice, and in 2022 we added support for Python. We continue to invest in our Powered by Snowflake program to help companies build, operate, and market applications in the Data Cloud by supporting developers across all stages of the application journey. As of January&#160;31, 2023, we had over 820 Powered by Snowflake registrants. Powered by Snowflake partners have access to go-to-market, customer support, and engineering expertise.We have an industry-vertical focus, which allows us to go to market with tailored business solutions. For example, we have launched the Telecom Data Cloud, the Financial Services Data Cloud, the Media Data Cloud, the Healthcare and Life Sciences Data Cloud, and the Retail Data Cloud. Each of these brings together Snowflake&#8217;s platform capabilities with industry-specific partner solutions and datasets to drive business growth and deliver improved experiences and insights.Our business benefits from powerful network effects. The Data Cloud will continue to grow as organizations move their siloed data from cloud-based repositories and on-premises data centers to the Data Cloud. The more customers adopt our platform, the more data can be exchanged with other Snowflake customers, partners, data providers, and data consumers, enhancing the value of our platform for all users. We believe this network effect will help us drive our vision of the Data Cloud. 7Table of ContentsOur platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. As of January&#160;31, 2023, we had 7,828 total customers, increasing from 5,967 customers as of January&#160;31, 2022. As of January&#160;31, 2023, our customers included 573 of the Forbes Global 2000, based on the 2022 Forbes Global 2000 list, and those customers contributed approximately 41% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the Global 2000 list by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. As our customers experience the benefits of our platform, they typically expand their usage significantly, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate, which was 158% as of January&#160;31, 2023. The number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 184 to 330 as of January&#160;31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. We have achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, our revenue was $2.1 billion, $1.2 billion, and $592.0 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 69% and 106%, respectively. Our net loss was $797.5 million, $679.9 million, and $539.1 million for the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The Rise of the Data CloudData exists everywhere, but is often held hostage in silos by machines, applications, networks, and clouds. In order to access the value of this data, organizations are undergoing massive digital transformation initiatives, and data is driving operations for many modern enterprises. In an effort to mobilize data, companies have invested billions of dollars in disparate on-premises systems, infrastructure clouds, and application clouds. Yet, there are a myriad of challenges associated with legacy data solutions and the data silo problem persists. We believe the Data Cloud can enable a world without data silos, allowing organizations to effortlessly discover, access, derive insights from, and share data from a variety of sources. Customers can share and provide access to each other&#8217;s data or data products, augment data science and machine learning algorithms with more data sets, connect global supply chains through data hubs, build data products, and create new monetization channels by connecting data providers and consumers. As the Data Cloud grows through broad adoption and increasing usage, there are enhanced benefits from greater data availability. Moving forward, we are continuing to foster these benefits through industry-specific Data Clouds and the Powered by Snowflake program.Our SolutionOur platform is built on a cloud-native architecture that leverages the massive scalability and performance of the public cloud.

Feed data and analytics directly into business applications in the context of daily workstreams.ArchitectureOur platform was built from the ground up to take advantage of the cloud, and is built on an innovative multi-cluster, shared data architecture. It consists of three independently scalable layers deployed and generally connected globally across public clouds and regions:&#8226;Centralized storage. The storage layer is based on scalable cloud storage and can manage structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It can be grown independently of compute resources, allowing for maximum scalability and elasticity, and ensures a single, persistent copy of the data. The stored data is automatically partitioned, and metadata is extracted during loading to enable efficient processing. &#8226;Multi-cluster compute. The compute layer is designed to capitalize on the instant elasticity and performance of the public cloud. Compute clusters can be spun up and down easily within seconds, enabling our platform to retrieve the optimal data required from the storage layer to answer queries and transform data with optimized price-performance. This functionality allows a multitude of users and use cases to operate on a single copy of the data. &#8226;Cloud services. The cloud services layer acts as the brain of the platform ensuring the different components work in unison to deliver a consistent user-friendly customer experience. It performs a variety of tasks, including security operations, system monitoring, query optimization, and metadata and state tracking throughout the platform. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 38 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are generally interconnected through our Snowgrid technology to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a global and consistent user experience.12Table of ContentsOur TechnologyInnovation is at the core of our culture. We have developed innovative technology across our platform, including managed service, storage, query capabilities, compute model, data sharing, global infrastructure, and integrated security.&#8226;Managed Service&#9702;High availability. Within a region, all components of our platform are distributed over multiple data centers to ensure high availability. Hardware and software problems are automatically detected and addressed by the system, with full transparency to our customers. &#9702;Transactions. Our platform supports full ACID compliant transactional integrity, ensuring that data remains consistent even when our platform is concurrently used by many users and use cases. &#9702;Data availability and recovery. Our platform provides customers the ability to replicate data across various deployments, create point-in-time consistent snapshots of data, and view or recover deleted or changed data over a configured period of time. This allows customers to avoid difficult trade-offs between high recovery times, data loss, or downtime.&#8226;Storage&#9702;Columnar data. Our platform stores data in a proprietary columnar representation, which optimizes the performance of analytical and reporting queries. It also provides high compression ratios, resulting in economic benefits for customers.&#9702;Micro-partitioning. Our platform automatically partitions all data it stores without the need for user specification or configuration. It creates small files called &#8220;micro partitions&#8221; based on size, enabling optimizations in query processing to retrieve only the data relevant for user queries, simplifying user administration and enhancing performance. &#9702;Metadata. When data is ingested, our platform automatically extracts and stores metadata to speed up query processing. It does so by collecting data distribution information for all columns in every micro-partition.&#9702;Semi-structured and unstructured data. In addition to structured, relational data, our platform supports semi-structured data, including JSON, Avro, and Parquet, and unstructured data, including PDF documents, screenshots, recordings, and images. Data in these formats can be ingested and queried with performance comparable to a relational, structured representation. &#8226;Query Capabilities. Our platform is engineered to query petabytes of data. It implements support for a large subset of the ANSI SQL standard for read operations and data modification operations. Our platform provides additional features, including:&#9702;Time travel. Our platform keeps track of all changes happening to a table, which enables customers to query previous versions based on their preferences. Customers can query as of a relative point in time or as of an absolute point in time. This has a broad array of use cases for customers, including error recovery, time-based analysis, and data quality checks.&#9702;Cloning. Our architecture enables us to offer zero-copy cloning, an operation by which entire tables, schemas, or databases can be duplicated&#8212;or cloned&#8212;without having to copy or duplicate the underlying data. Our platform leverages the separation between cloud services and storage to be able to track independent clones of objects sharing the same physical copy of the underlying data. This enables a variety of customer use cases such as making copies of production data for data scientists, creating custom snapshots in time, or testing data pipelines.13Table of Contents&#8226;Compute Model. Our platform offers a variety of capabilities to operate on data, from ingestion to transformation, as well as rich query and analysis. Our compute services are primarily presented to users in one of two models, either through explicit specification of compute clusters or through a number of serverless features.&#9702;Compute Clusters. Our platform exposes compute clusters as a core concept. Our customers are able to create as few or as many compute clusters as they want and specify compute capacity at tiered levels. These clusters can be configured to run only when needed, with cluster instantiation operations typically completed in seconds. Compute clusters can also be configured as a multi-cluster warehouse in which our platform can automatically add and remove additional instances of a given cluster to address variations in query demands. This gives us the ability to offer extremely high levels of concurrency with a simple configuration specification. We also offer warehouse recommendations for workloads that have large memory requirements, such as machine learning use cases.&#9702;Serverless features. We offer a number of additional services that automatically provide the capacity our customers require. For example, our data ingestion service automatically ingests data from cloud storage and allocates compute capacity based on the amount of data ingested; our clustering service continuously rearranges the physical layout of data to ensure conformity with clustering key specifications, improving performance; our materialized views service propagates changes from underlying tables to views that have materialized subsets or summaries; our replication service moves data between regions or clouds; our search optimization service analyzes changes in data, maintains information that speeds up lookup queries, and accelerates queries performing lookups of specific values; and our query acceleration service automatically offloads parts of eligible queries to shared, flexible compute clusters to handle high-burst workloads.&#8226;Data Sharing. In our platform, data sharing is defined through access control and not through data movement. As such, the data consumer sees no latency relative to updates from the data provider, and incurs no cost to move or transform data to make it usable. Based on the same technology principles, our platform enables data clean rooms.&#8226;Global Infrastructure&#9702;Database replication. Our platform enables customers to replicate data from one region or public cloud to another region or public cloud while maintaining transactional integrity.&#9702;Business continuity. Our platform enables failing over and failing back a database and redirecting clients transparently across regions or public clouds. This provides an integrated and global disaster recovery capability.&#9702;Global listings for sharing. Our platform enables a listing to be published globally to access consumers across regions or public clouds.&#8226;Built-in Security. We built our platform with security as a core tenet. Our platform provides a number of capabilities for customers to confidently use our platform while preserving the security requirements of their organizations, including:&#9702;Authentication. Our platform supports rich authentication capabilities, including federated authentication with a variety of identity providers, as well as support for multi-factor authentication.&#9702;Access control. Our platform provides a fine-grained security model based on role-based access control. It provides granular privileges on system objects and actions.&#9702;Data encryption. Our platform encrypts all data, both in motion and at rest, and simplifies operations by providing automatic re-keying of data. It also supports customer-managed keys, where an additional layer of encryption is provided by keys controlled by customers, giving them the ability to control access to the data.14Table of ContentsSales and MarketingWe sell our platform primarily through our direct sales team, which consists of field sales and inside sales professionals segmented by customer industry, size, and region.

We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to expand our platform.Our CompetitionThe markets we serve are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. With the introduction of new technologies and innovations, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense. Our competition includes the following:&#8226;large, well-established, public cloud providers that generally compete in all of our markets, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP);&#8226;less-established public and private cloud companies with products that compete in some of our markets; &#8226;other established vendors of legacy database solutions or big data offerings; and&#8226;new or emerging entrants seeking to develop competing technologies.15Table of ContentsWe believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:&#8226;ability to provide and innovate around an architecture that is purpose-built for the cloud;&#8226;ability to efficiently and seamlessly ingest diverse data types in one location at scale;&#8226;ability to drive business value and ROI;&#8226;ability to support multiple use cases in one platform, including various industry-specific use cases;&#8226;ability to provide seamless and secure access of data to many users simultaneously;&#8226;ability to seamlessly and securely share and move data across public clouds or regions;&#8226;ability to provide a consistent user experience across multiple public cloud providers;&#8226;ability to provide pricing transparency and optimized price-performance benefits;&#8226;ability to elastically scale up and scale down in high-intensity use cases;&#8226;ease of deployment, implementation, and use;&#8226;choice of programming language; &#8226;performance, scalability, and reliability;&#8226;security and governance; and&#8226;quality of service and customer satisfaction.See the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a more comprehensive description of risks related to competition.SeasonalityHistorically, we have received a higher volume of orders from new and existing customers in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. As a result, we have historically seen higher non-GAAP free cash flow in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year, and our sequential growth in remaining performance obligations has historically been highest in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. For more information, including a definition of non-GAAP free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), see the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;Human Capital ResourcesGeneral As of January&#160;31, 2023, we had 5,884 employees operating across 33 countries. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment. In certain countries in which we operate, such as France, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements, which include works councils and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.LocationWe are a Delaware corporation with a globally distributed workforce. We recruit and hire employees in jurisdictions around the world based on a range of factors, including the available talent pool, the type of work being performed, the relative cost of labor, regulatory requirements and costs, and other considerations. Some of our employees continue to work remotely following the COVID-19 pandemic, but the majority of our workforce has returned to physical offices.Culture and EngagementWe consider our culture and employees to be important to our success. Our culture is driven by our core company values:16Table of Contents&#8226;Put Customers First: We only succeed when our customers succeed, so we focus on what matters most to them.&#8226;Integrity Always: We are open, honest, and respectful.&#8226;Think Big: We set big goals that will make a positive impact and a lasting difference.&#8226;Be Excellent: We hold ourselves to the highest standards to achieve quality and excellence in everything we do.&#8226;Make Each Other the Best: We bring ideas and people together through respect and collaboration.&#8226;Get it Done: We follow through on our commitments and deliver results.&#8226;Own It: We hold ourselves accountable at all times.&#8226;Embrace Each Other&#8217;s Differences: We are mindful that everyone has different experiences, and we use our differences to strengthen who we are.Total RewardsWe have invested substantial time and resources in building our team, and we measure employee performance against our company values. We are dependent on our management, highly-skilled software engineers, and sales personnel, and it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain valuable employees. To facilitate attraction and retention, we strive to provide opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation and benefits programs.We use a combination of fixed and variable cash compensation for all employees, and we award equity compensation to certain employees that is designed to align our employees&#8217; interests with those of our stockholders. Eligible employees are also able to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows employees to purchase our stock at a 15 percent discount up to U.S. Internal Revenue Code limits. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local legal requirements and to be competitive in the marketplace.Intellectual PropertyIntellectual property rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual protections, to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand. We use open source software in our platform.As of January&#160;31, 2023, we held 486 issued U.S. patents and had 311 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 117 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between January 2024 and July 2042. As of January&#160;31, 2023, we held 27 registered trademarks in the United States, and also held 363 registered or protected trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.17Table of ContentsWe control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements, and we control and monitor access to our software, documentation, proprietary technology, and other confidential information. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes, and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and partners. See the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.Government RegulationOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those related to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, environmental or related requirements or disclosures, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in future periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;Available InformationOur website address is www.snowflake.com.

RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should not interpret our disclosure of any of the following risks to imply that such risks have not already materialized.Risks Related to Our Business and OperationsWe have experienced rapid revenue growth, which may not be indicative of our future performance, and we have a limited operating history, both of which make it difficult to forecast our future results of operations.Our revenue was $2.1 billion, $1.2 billion, and $592.0 million for the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As a result of our historical rapid growth, limited operating history, and unstable macroeconomic conditions, our ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations, including revenue, remaining performance obligations (RPO), and the percentage of RPO we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods, is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth and platform consumption. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including increased competition, changes to technology (including changes in software or underlying cloud infrastructure), and reduced demand for our platform as customers seek to optimize consumption, rationalize budgets, and prioritize cash flow management (including through shortened contract duration) in response to adverse economic conditions. In addition, we have recently seen, and may continue to see, our newer customers increase their consumption of our platform at a slower pace than our more tenured customers. As a result of the foregoing and our rapid revenue growth in prior periods, we expect our revenue growth rate to decline in future periods, and a decline in our revenue growth rate could adversely affect investors&#8217; perceptions of our business, and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. We have also encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described below. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer.We may not have visibility into our future financial position and results of operations.Customers generally consume our platform by using compute, storage, and data transfer resources. Unlike a subscription-based business model, in which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription, we generally recognize revenue on consumption. Because our customers have flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we do not have the visibility into the timing of revenue recognition that a typical subscription-based software company has. There is a risk that customers will consume our platform more slowly than we expect, including in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions, and we have recently seen, and may continue to see, our newer customers increase their consumption of our platform at a slower pace than our more tenured customers. As a result, actual results may differ from our forecasts, and our results of operations in a given period should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance.19Table of ContentsWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.We have experienced net losses in each period since inception. We generated net losses of $797.5 million, $679.9 million, and $539.1 million for the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods. In particular, we intend to continue to invest significant resources to further develop our platform, expand our sales, marketing, and professional services teams, and retain our employees. In addition, our platform currently operates on public cloud infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and our costs and gross margins are significantly influenced by the prices we are able to negotiate with these public cloud providers, which in certain cases are also our competitors. If we fail to meet any minimum commitments under these third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, we may be required to pay the difference, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. We will also incur increased general and administrative expenses associated with our growth, including costs related to internal systems and operating as a public company. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, or our revenue growth rate may be slower than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset the increase in operating expenses resulting from these investments. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, or if we are unable to achieve the revenue growth that we expect from these investments, the value of our business and common stock may significantly decrease.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.The markets in which we operate are rapidly evolving and highly competitive. As these markets continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter such markets, we expect competition to intensify. Our current competitors include:&#8226;large, well-established, public cloud providers that generally compete in all of our markets, including AWS, Azure, and GCP;&#8226;less-established public and private cloud companies with products that compete in some of our markets;&#8226;other established vendors of legacy database solutions or big data offerings; and&#8226;new or emerging entrants seeking to develop competing technologies.We compete based on various factors, including price, performance, breadth of use cases, multi-cloud availability, brand recognition and reputation, customer support, and differentiated capabilities, including ease of implementation and data migration, ease of administration and use, scalability and reliability, data governance, security and compatibility with existing standards, programming languages, and third-party products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater brand recognition, customer relationships, and financial, technical, and other resources than we do, and may be able to respond more effectively than us to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, customer requirements, and buying practices. We currently only offer our platform on the public clouds provided by AWS, Azure, and GCP, which are also some of our primary competitors. Currently, a substantial majority of our business is run on the AWS public cloud. There is risk that one or more of these public cloud providers could use its respective control of its public clouds to embed innovations or privileged interoperating capabilities in competing products, bundle competing products, provide us unfavorable pricing, leverage its public cloud customer relationships to exclude us from opportunities, and treat us and our customers differently&#160;with respect to terms and conditions or regulatory requirements than it would treat its similarly situated customers. Further, they have the resources to acquire, invest in, or partner with existing and emerging providers of competing technology and thereby accelerate adoption of those competing technologies. All of the foregoing could make it difficult or impossible for us to provide products and services that compete favorably with those of the public cloud providers.For all of these reasons, competition may negatively impact our ability to maintain and grow consumption of our platform or put downward pressure on our prices and gross margins, any of which could materially harm our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.20Table of ContentsIf we fail to innovate in response to changing customer needs, new technologies, or other market requirements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.We compete in markets that evolve rapidly. We believe that the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as customers increasingly base their purchases of cloud data platforms on a broad range of factors, including performance and scale, markets addressed, types of data processed, ease of data ingestion, user experience and programming languages, use of artificial intelligence, and data governance and regulatory compliance. We introduced data warehousing on our platform in 2014 as our core use case, and our customers subsequently began using our platform for additional workloads, including data lake, data engineering, data science and machine learning, application development, cybersecurity, Unistore, and collaboration. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to innovate and increase customer adoption of our platform and the Data Cloud, including Snowflake Marketplace. Further, the value of our platform to customers is increased to the extent they are able to use it to process and access all types of data. We need to continue to invest in technologies, services, and partnerships that increase the types of data available and processed on our platform and the ease with which customers can ingest data into our platform. We must also continue to enhance our data sharing and marketplace capabilities so customers can share their data with internal business units, customers, and other third parties, acquire additional third-party data to combine with their own data in order to gain additional business insights, and develop and monetize applications on our platform. As we develop, acquire, and introduce new services and technologies, including those that may incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning, we may be subject to new or heightened legal, ethical, and other challenges. In addition, our platform requires third-party public cloud infrastructure to operate. Currently, we use public cloud offerings provided by AWS, Azure, and GCP. We will need to continue to innovate to optimize our offerings for these and other public clouds that our customers require, particularly as we expand internationally. Further, the markets in which we compete are subject to evolving industry standards and regulations, resulting in increasing data governance and compliance requirements for us and our customers and partners. To the extent we expand further into the public sector and highly regulated countries and industries, our platform and operations may need to address additional requirements specific to those markets, including data sovereignty requirements. If we are unable to enhance our platform or operations to keep pace with these rapidly evolving customer requirements, or if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, or more securely than our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we or our third-party service providers experience an actual or perceived security breach or unauthorized parties otherwise obtain access to our customers&#8217; data, our data, or our platform, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our platform may be reduced, and we may incur significant liabilities.Our platform processes, stores, and transmits our own sensitive data as well as customers&#8217; and partners&#8217; proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, such as personal information, protected health information, and financial data. Our platform is built on the infrastructure of third-party public cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. We also use third-party service providers and sub-processors to help us deliver services to our customers and their end-users, as well as for our internal business operations. These vendors may process, store, or transmit data of our employees, partners, customers, and customers&#8217; end-users. Even though we may not control the security measures of these vendors, we may be responsible for any breach of such measures.21Table of ContentsThreats to information systems and data come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer &#8220;hackers,&#8221; internal and external personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors. We and the third parties on which we rely are subject to a variety of evolving cyber threats, including unauthorized intrusions, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware attacks, business email compromises, computer malware, social engineering attacks (including phishing), internal and external personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software vulnerabilities, and software or hardware disruptions or failures, all of which are prevalent in our industry and our customers&#8217; and partners&#8217; industries. Furthermore, future business expansions or acquisitions could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. The techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to our and our third-party providers&#8217; platforms, systems, networks, or physical facilities in which data is stored or processed, or through which data is transmitted change frequently, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. In addition, ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly frequent and severe, and we may be unwilling or unable to make ransom payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. In general, cybersecurity breaches or efforts to mitigate security vulnerabilities could lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, diversion of funds, unexpected service interruptions, increased insurance costs, and other harm to our business, reputation, and competitive position.We are a target of threat actors seeking unauthorized access to our or our customers&#8217; or partners&#8217; systems or data or to disrupt our operations or ability to provide our services. Threat actors may also exploit vulnerabilities in, or obtain unauthorized access to, platforms, systems, networks, or physical facilities utilized by our third-party service providers. Any security breach of our platform, our operational systems, our software (including open source software), our physical facilities, or the systems of our third-party service providers or sub-processors, or the perception that one has occurred, could result in litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory enforcement actions, investigations, fines, penalties, mitigation and remediation costs, disputes, reputational harm, diversion of management&#8217;s attention, and other liabilities and damage to our business. We have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. Such mandatory disclosures are costly and could lead to negative publicity, loss of customer or partner confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, diversion of management&#8217;s attention, governmental investigations, and the expenditure of significant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach.A security incident may also cause us to breach, or lead to claims that we have breached, customer contracts or legal obligations. As a result, we could be subject to legal action (including the imposition of fines or penalties) and our customers could end their relationships with us. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations.Litigation resulting from security breaches may adversely affect our business. Unauthorized access to our platform, systems, networks, or physical facilities could result in litigation with our customers, our customers&#8217; end-users, or other relevant stakeholders. These proceedings could force us to spend money in defense or settlement, divert management&#8217;s time and attention, increase our costs of doing business, or adversely affect our reputation. We could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our platform capabilities in response to such litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate for data security, indemnification obligations, or other liabilities. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements) could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Risks related to our systems and security breaches are likely to increase as we continue to expand our platform and geographic footprint, grow our customer and partner base, and process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of data. In addition, some of our employees work remotely, including while traveling for business, which increases our cyber security risk, creates data accessibility concerns, and makes us more susceptible to security breaches or business disruptions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.22Table of ContentsWe could suffer disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform or with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which it relies.Our business depends on our platform to be available without disruption. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform and with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which our platform relies. These problems can be caused by a variety of factors, including introductions of new functionality, vulnerabilities, and defects in proprietary and open source software, human error or misconduct, natural disasters (such as tornadoes, earthquakes, or fires), capacity constraints, design limitations, denial of service attacks, or other security-related incidents.Further, if our contractual and other business relationships with our public cloud providers are terminated, suspended, or suffer a material change to which we are unable to adapt, such as the elimination of services or features on which we depend, we could be unable to provide our platform and could experience significant delays and incur additional expense in transitioning customers to a different public cloud provider.Any disruptions, outages, defects, and other performance and quality problems with our platform or with the public cloud and internet infrastructure on which it relies, or any material change in our contractual and other business relationships with our public cloud providers, could result in reduced use of our platform, increased expenses, including service credit obligations, and harm to our brand and reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We expect fluctuations in our financial results, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to our results of operations, our stock price could decline.Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our results of operations include the following:&#8226;fluctuations in demand for our platform or changes in our pricing model;&#8226;fluctuations in usage of our platform, including as a result of customer optimization efforts that result in reduced consumption to execute workloads;&#8226;our ability to attract new customers;&#8226;our ability to retain existing customers and drive their increased consumption of our platform;&#8226;customer expansion rates, particularly for newer customers who we have recently seen, and may continue to see, increase their consumption of our platform at a slower pace than our more tenured customers;&#8226;timing, amount, and cost of our investments to expand the capacity of our public cloud providers;&#8226;seasonality;&#8226;investments in new features, functionality, and programming languages, including investments in making our platform available to store and process highly regulated data or comply with new or existing data sovereignty requirements;&#8226;fluctuations in consumption resulting from the introduction of new features, technologies, or capabilities to our software, systems, or to underlying cloud infrastructure, including features or capabilities that may increase or decrease the consumption required to execute existing or future workloads, like better storage compression and cloud infrastructure processor improvements;&#8226;the timing and frequency of purchases;&#8226;the speed with which customers are able to migrate data onto our platform;&#8226;fluctuations or delays in purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or enhancements by us or our competitors;23Table of Contents&#8226;changes in customers&#8217; budgets and in the timing of their budget cycles and purchasing decisions;&#8226;our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;&#8226;the amount and timing of operating expenses, particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses, including commissions;&#8226;the amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation, goodwill impairments, and other non-cash charges;&#8226;the amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training, and integrating new employees and retaining and motivating existing employees;&#8226;the effects and timing of acquisitions and their integration;&#8226;general political, social, market, and economic conditions, uncertainty, or volatility, both domestically and internationally, as well as political, social, and economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers and partners participate or on which they rely;&#8226;health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;&#8226;the impact, or timing of our adoption, of new accounting pronouncements;&#8226;changes in regulatory or legal environments, including the interpretation or enforcement of regulatory or legal requirements, that may cause us to incur, among other things, expenses associated with compliance;&#8226;the overall tax rate for our business, which may be affected by the mix of income we earn in the United States and in jurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of stock-based compensation, and the effects of changes in our business;&#8226;the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period in which such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;&#8226;rising inflation and our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;&#8226;fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated or measured in foreign currencies;&#8226;fluctuations or impairments in, or the full loss of, the market values of our strategic investments or of our portfolio, including changes to the value or accessibility of our cash and cash equivalents as a result of economic conditions or bank failures;&#8226;fluctuations in interest rates;&#8226;changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers; and&#8226;significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform.Any of these and other factors, or the cumulative effect of some of these factors, may cause our results of operations to vary significantly or be adversely affected. If our results of operations fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class actions.24Table of ContentsFailure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and platform.We must expand our sales and marketing organization to increase our sales to new and existing customers. We plan to continue expanding our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally, particularly our direct enterprise sales organization focused on sales to the world&#8217;s largest organizations. We believe there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the necessary skills and technical knowledge, particularly as we target larger enterprise customers. It requires significant time and resources to effectively onboard new sales and marketing personnel. We also plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs that are industry-specific and focused on large organizations. Once a new customer begins using our platform, our sales team will need to continue to focus on expanding consumption with that customer. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources, including in industries and sales channels in which we have limited experience to date. Our business and results of operations will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts generate increases in revenue that are smaller than anticipated. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.Sales efforts to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with respect to sales to smaller organizations.Sales to large customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller organizations, such as longer sales cycles, more complex customer requirements, including our ability to partner with third parties that advise such customers or help them integrate their IT solutions, substantial upfront sales costs, and less predictability in completing some of our sales. For example, large customers may require considerable time to evaluate and test our platform or new features prior to making a purchase decision. In addition, large customers may be switching from legacy on-premises solutions when purchasing our products, and may rely on third parties with whom we do not have relationships when making purchasing decisions. A number of factors also influence the length and variability of our sales cycle, including the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our platform, the renegotiation of existing agreements to cover additional workloads, changing laws, the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles, and the competitive nature of evaluation and purchasing approval processes. As a result, the length of our sales cycle, from identification of the opportunity to deal closure, may vary significantly from customer to customer, with sales to large enterprises typically taking longer to complete. We have also historically seen consumption growth from large enterprises take longer than when compared to smaller enterprises. Moreover, large customers often begin to deploy our products on a limited basis but nevertheless demand implementation services and negotiate pricing discounts, which increase our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that sales to these customers will justify our substantial upfront investment. If we fail to effectively manage these risks associated with sales cycles and sales to large customers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be affected.Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy, or reductions in cloud spending, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.Our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers and potential customers. Negative conditions or volatility in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, bank failures, international trade relations, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations, or the existence of pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), political turmoil, natural catastrophes, warfare, or terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Japan, or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on cloud technologies, and negatively affect the growth of our business. For example, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has created volatility in the global capital markets and could have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain. In addition, unfavorable conditions in the general economy may negatively impact our customers&#8217; budgets or cash flow, which could impact the contract terms, including payment terms, our customers demand from us. Competitors, many of whom are larger and have greater financial resources than we do, may respond to challenging market conditions by lowering prices in an attempt to attract our customers. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown, instability, or recovery, generally or within any particular industry.25Table of ContentsOur growth depends on the development, expansion, and success of our partner relationships.As part of our vision for the Data Cloud, we will need to grow and maintain a network of data providers, data consumers, and data application developers. The relationships we have with these partners, and that our partners have with our customers, provide our customers with enhanced value from our platform and the Data Cloud, including the Snowflake Marketplace. Our future growth will be increasingly dependent on the success of these relationships, and if we are unsuccessful in growing and maintaining these relationships or the types and quality of data supported by or available for consumption on our platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.Additionally, a small but increasing portion of our revenue is generated as a result of our relationships with global system integrators, managed service providers, and resellers. Increasingly, we and our customers rely on these partners to provide professional services, including customer implementations and migrations from legacy solutions, and there may not be enough qualified partners available, or we may not be able to develop or maintain relationships with enough partners, to meet customer demand. While we provide our partners with training and other enablement programs, these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently, and our return on these investments may be lower than expected. In addition, new partners may require extensive training or significant time and resources to achieve productivity. If we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of these partners, or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their interactions with our customers, our ability to attract and retain new customers and expand customer consumption of our platform may be impacted, and our operating results and growth rate may be harmed.If we are unable to successfully manage the growth of our professional services business and improve our profit margin from these services, our operating results will be harmed.Our professional services business, which performs implementation services for our customers, has grown larger and more complex as our product revenue has increased. We believe our future success depends in part on investment in professional services to facilitate customer code conversion and migration from legacy solutions and adoption of our platform, especially with large enterprises. As a result, our sales efforts have and will continue to be focused on helping our customers more quickly realize the value of our platform and the Data Cloud rather than on the profitability of our professional services business. We price our professional services based on the anticipated cost of those services and, as a result, we expect to improve the gross profit percentage of our professional services business over time. If we are unable to manage the growth of our professional services business and improve our profit margin from these services, our operating results, including our profit margins, will be harmed.If we lose key members of our management team or are unable to attract and retain the executives and employees we need to support our operations and growth, our business and future growth prospects may be harmed.Our success depends in part on the continued services of Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael P. Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer, and our other executive officers, as well as our other key employees in the areas of research and development and sales and marketing.From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team or other key employees resulting from the hiring or departure of these personnel. Our executive officers and other key employees are employed on an at-will basis, which means that these personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, or the failure by our executive team to effectively work with our employees and lead our company could harm our business. In addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud-based data platform products, experienced sales professionals, and expert customer support personnel. We also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers because of the sophistication of our platform. 26Table of ContentsIn order to continue to hire and retain highly qualified personnel, we will need to continue to hire in new locations around the world and manage return to work and remote working policies, which may add to the complexity and costs of our business operations. From time to time, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and the acceptance by these companies of remote or hybrid work environments may increase the competition for talent. In addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the actual or perceived value of our equity awards declines or continues to experience significant volatility, or if our existing employees receive significant proceeds from liquidating their previously vested equity awards, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees. Furthermore, current and prospective employees may believe that their equity award offers have limited upside, and our competitors may be able to offer more appealing compensation packages. In order to retain our existing employees and manage potential attrition, including as a result of recent stock price decreases and continued market volatility that impact the actual or perceived value of our equity awards, we may issue additional equity awards or provide our employees with increased cash compensation, which could negatively impact our results of operations and be dilutive to stockholders. Finally, if we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that we or these employees have breached our or their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources.We also believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date and that the critical nature of the platform that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. As our workforce becomes larger and more distributed around the world, we may not be able to maintain important aspects of our culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed.If the availability of our platform does not meet our service-level commitments to our customers, our current and future revenue may be negatively impacted.We typically commit to our customers that our platform will maintain a minimum service-level of availability. If we are unable to meet these commitments, we may be obligated to provide customers with additional capacity, which could significantly affect our revenue. We rely on public cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, and any availability interruption in the public cloud could result in us not meeting our service-level commitments to our customers. In some cases, we may not have a contractual right with our public cloud providers that compensates us for any losses due to availability interruptions in the public cloud. Further, any failure to meet our service-level commitments could damage our reputation and adoption of our platform, and we could face loss of revenue from reduced future consumption of our platform. Any service-level failures could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We assume liability for data breaches, intellectual property infringement, and other claims, which exposes us to substantial potential liability. In our customer contracts, we assume liability for security breaches and data protection claims caused by us and by certain third parties on which we rely. Our contracts with customers, investors, and other third parties may also include indemnification provisions under which we agree to defend and indemnify them against claims and losses arising from alleged infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of intellectual property rights and for other matters. Although we attempt to limit our liability and indemnity obligations and negotiate corresponding liability and indemnification rights with vendors that would require them to contribute to our indemnity obligations, we may not be successful in doing so, and an event triggering our liability or indemnity obligations could give rise to multiple claims involving multiple customers or other third parties. There is no assurance that our applicable insurance coverage, if any, would cover, in whole or in part, any such liability or indemnity obligations. We may be liable for up to the full amount of the contractual claims, which could result in substantial liability or material disruption to our business or could negatively impact our relationships with customers or other third parties, reduce demand for our platform, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 27Table of ContentsAcquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify, pose integration challenges, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, joint ventures, and platform technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technology, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Further, the proceeds we received from our initial public offering (IPO) in September 2020 increased the likelihood that we will devote resources to exploring larger and more complex acquisitions and investments than we have previously attempted. For example, in March 2022 we acquired Streamlit, Inc., a privately-held company which provides an open-source framework built to simplify and accelerate the creation of data applications, representing a larger and more complex acquisition than our prior endeavors. Any such acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable opportunities, whether or not the transactions are completed, and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties or unexpected costs assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of an acquired company choose not to work for us, their software is not easily adapted to work with our platform, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management, or otherwise. Any such transactions that we are able to complete may not result in the synergies or other benefits we expect to achieve, which could result in substantial impairment charges. These transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our results of operations.As part of our corporate development program, we invest in companies to support our key business initiatives. These companies range from early, growth stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams. Our strategic investments are subject to risk of inability to achieve the desired strategic synergies and partial or total loss of investment capital. Furthermore, our competitors may invest in these companies alongside us, and may obtain information about our corporate development program or other business plans. The financial success of our investment is typically dependent on an exit in favorable market conditions. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which can include failure to achieve strategic business objectives as well as failure to achieve a favorable exit, we could recognize an impairment or loss on all or part of our investment. In addition, in certain cases we may be required to consolidate one or more of our strategic investee&#8217;s financial results into ours. Fluctuations in any such investee&#8217;s financial results, due to general market conditions, bank failures, or otherwise, could negatively affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or the price of our common stock. If one or more of such investees fails to timely provide us with information necessary for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and disclosures, we may be unable to report our financial results in a timely manner, which would negatively affect our business and the price of our common stock.Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our remaining performance obligations.Historically, we have received a higher volume of orders from new and existing customers in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. As a result, we have historically seen higher non-GAAP free cash flow in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year, and our sequential growth in remaining performance obligations has historically been highest in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. We expect this seasonality to become more pronounced as we continue to target large enterprise customers based on their procurement, budgeting, and deployment cycles. For more information, including a definition of non-GAAP free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;We do business with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies, and heavily regulated organizations; as a result, we face risks related to the procurement process, budget, delays, and product decisions driven by statutory and regulatory determinations, termination of contracts, and compliance with government contracting requirements.We provide our platform to the U.S. government, state and local governments, foreign governments, and heavily regulated organizations directly and through our partners. We have made, and may continue to make, significant investments to support future sales opportunities in the government sector, including obtaining government certifications. However, government certification requirements may change, we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more required government certifications, or we may be required to make unexpected changes to our business or products in order to obtain or sustain such certifications. As a result, our ability to sell into the government sector could be restricted until we satisfy the requirements of such certifications.28Table of ContentsA substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our distribution and reseller partners. Doing business with government entities, whether directly or indirectly, presents a variety of risks. Many government entities need significant education regarding our business model, as well as the uses and benefits of our platform. The procurement process for governments and their agencies is highly competitive and time-consuming, and government decisions about their procurement needs may, in certain circumstances, be subject to political influence. To pursue these opportunities, we incur significant up-front time and expense, which subjects us to additional compliance risks and costs, without any assurance that we (or a third-party distributor or reseller) will win a contract. Beyond this, demand for our platform may be adversely impacted by public sector budgetary cycles, and funding availability that in any given fiscal cycle may be reduced or delayed, including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown. Further, if we or our partners are successful in receiving a competitive contract award, that award could be challenged by one or more competitive bidders in a legal action known as a &#8220;bid protest.&#8221; Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining or preserving contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. As a result of these lengthy and uncertain sales cycles, it is difficult for us to predict the timing of entering into customer agreements with government entities or with our distribution and reseller partners in the government market.In addition, public sector customers may have contractual, statutory, or regulatory rights to terminate current contracts with us or our third-party distributors or resellers for convenience or default. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we may only be able to collect fees for platform consumption prior to termination and settlement expenses. If a contract is terminated due to a default, we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services or be precluded from doing further business with government entities. Further, entities providing products or services to governments, whether directly or indirectly, are required to comply with a variety of complex laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. Such laws, regulations, and contractual provisions impose compliance obligations that are more burdensome than those typically encountered in commercial contracts, and they often give customers in the government market substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. These rights and remedies may relate to intellectual property, price protection, the accuracy of information provided to the government, and termination rights. In addition, governments may use procurement requirements as an alternative to lawmaking, and impose stricter requirements than would apply to the commercial sector in areas that are not directly related to the purchase. These rules and requirements may apply to us or third-party resellers or distributors whose practices we may not control. Such parties&#8217; non-compliance could result in repercussions for us with respect to contractual and customer satisfaction issues.In addition, federal, state, and local governments routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions. If, as a result of an audit or investigation, it is determined that we have failed to comply with applicable requirements, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits or payments we have received, costs associated with the triggering of price reduction clauses, fines, and suspensions or debarment from future government business, and we may suffer reputational harm.Further, we are increasingly investing in doing business with customers and partners in heavily regulated industries, such as the financial services and health care industries. Existing and prospective customers, such as those in these industries, may be required to comply with more stringent regulations in connection with using and implementing our services or particular regulations regarding third-party vendors that may be interpreted differently by different customers. In addition, regulatory agencies may impose requirements toward third-party vendors generally, or our company in particular, that we may not be able to, or may not choose to, meet. In addition, customers in these heavily regulated areas and their regulators often have a right to conduct audits of our systems, products, and practices. In the event that one or more customers or their regulators determine that some aspect of our business does not meet regulatory requirements, we may be limited in our ability to continue or expand our business.29Table of ContentsOur customers also include a number of non-U.S. governments, to which similar procurement, budgetary, contract, and audit risks of U.S. government contracting also apply, particularly in certain emerging markets where our customer base is less established. Such sales may also heighten our exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws. In addition, compliance with complex regulations, security certifications, and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant financial and management resources. In certain jurisdictions, our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market. Further, our business and results of operations will be harmed if our efforts to do business with governments and heavily regulated organizations do not generate the anticipated increases in revenue. Each of these difficulties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Any litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.From time to time, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims, including claims related to the loss of employee equity grants upon termination, intellectual property claims, or securities class actions or other claims related to volatility in the trading price of our common stock. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management&#8217;s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Insurance might not cover such claims, provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements). A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, potentially harming our business, financial position, and results of operations. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim.Natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events could have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and the markets and communities in which we, our partners, and our customers operate. Our platform and the public cloud infrastructure on which our platform relies are vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, military conflict or war, terrorist attacks, criminal acts, sabotage, other intentional acts of vandalism and misconduct, geopolitical events, and disease. Some of our United States corporate offices in which we operate and certain of the public cloud data centers on which our platform runs are located in the San Francisco Bay Area and Pacific Northwest, regions known for seismic activity. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our facilities or the facilities of our public cloud providers could result in disruptions, outages, and other performance and quality problems. Similarly, the potential long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, its resurgence, or a new pandemic on the global economy and our business continue to be difficult to assess or predict. While many states and countries have reopened, the status of the global recovery remains uncertain and unpredictable. If we are unable to develop and maintain adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a catastrophic event and to execute successfully on those plans if such an event occurs, our business could be seriously harmed. Our current operations are international in scope, and we plan further geographic expansion, creating a variety of operational challenges.A component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. Customer accounts outside the United States generated 21% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will have the desired effect. For example, we anticipate that we will need to establish relationships with new partners in order to expand into certain countries, including China, and if we fail to identify, establish, and maintain such relationships, we may be unable to execute on our expansion plans. We expect that our international activities will continue to grow for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in existing and new international markets, which will require significant dedication of management attention and financial resources.Our current and future international business and operations involve a variety of risks, including:&#8226;slower than anticipated public cloud adoption by international businesses;30Table of Contents&#8226;changes in a specific country&#8217;s or region&#8217;s political, economic, or legal and regulatory environment, including the effects of Brexit, pandemics, tariffs, trade wars, sanctions, or long-term environmental risks;&#8226;the need to adapt and localize our platform for China and other countries, including as a result of data sovereignty requirements, and the engineering and related costs that we may incur when making those changes;&#8226;greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;&#8226;unexpected changes in, or the selective application of, trade relations, regulations, or laws;&#8226;new, evolving, and more stringent regulations relating to privacy and data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information;&#8226;differing and potentially more onerous labor regulations where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including regulations governing terminations in locations that do not permit at-will employment and deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations;&#8226;challenges inherent in efficiently managing, and the increased costs associated with, an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs that are specific to each jurisdiction;&#8226;difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, and regulatory systems;&#8226;increased travel, real estate, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with international operations, including increased costs associated with changing and potentially conflicting environmental regulations and requirements;&#8226;currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue, RPO, and expenses, and the cost and risk of utilizing mitigating derivative transactions and entering into hedging transactions to the extent we do so in the future;&#8226;limitations on, or charges or taxes associated with, our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;&#8226;laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general market preferences for local vendors;&#8226;limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties obtaining, maintaining, protecting, or enforcing our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks and patents;&#8226;political instability, military conflict or war, or terrorist activities;&#8226;COVID-19 or any other pandemics or epidemics that could result in decreased economic activity in certain markets; additional costs associated with travel, return to work, or other restrictions that are specific to certain markets; decreased use of our products and services; or decreased ability to import, export, or sell our products and services to existing or new customers in international markets;&#8226;exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), U.S. bribery laws, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; &#8226;burdens of complying with laws and regulations related to taxation; and&#8226;regulations, adverse tax burdens, and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult or costly to repatriate earnings and cash.We expect to invest substantial time and resources to further expand our international operations and, if we are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer.31Table of ContentsWe may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.We have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, including our IPO, and payments received from our customers. We cannot be certain if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business, which may require us to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all, particularly during times of market volatility and general economic instability. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to repurchase stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our common stock and diluting their interests.We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations and our ability to invest and hold our cash.Our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, and Brazilian reals, and will likely be denominated in other currencies in the future. Because we report our results of operations and revenue in U.S. dollars, we currently face exposure to foreign currency translation risk and may in the future face other foreign currency risks. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected. For example, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our platform to international customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, as our international operations expand, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the United States. These operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Exposure to these risks and fluctuations could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting estimates prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere herein. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates.&#8221; The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.Risks Related to Our Intellectual PropertyOur intellectual property rights may not protect our business or provide us with a competitive advantage.To be successful, we must protect our technology and brand in the United States and other jurisdictions through trademarks, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, service marks, invention assignments, contractual restrictions, and other intellectual property rights and confidentiality procedures. Despite our efforts to implement these protections, they may not protect our business or provide us with a competitive advantage for a variety of reasons, including:&#8226;the failure by us to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights for important innovations or maintain appropriate confidentiality and other protective measures to establish and maintain our trade secrets;32Table of Contents&#8226;to the extent a customer or partner owns any intellectual property created through a professional services engagement, our inability to use or monetize that intellectual property as part of our business;&#8226;uncertainty in, and evolution of, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights;&#8226;potential invalidation of our intellectual property rights through administrative processes or litigation;&#8226;our inability to detect infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property rights by third parties; and&#8226;other practical, resource, or business limitations on our ability to enforce our rights.Further, the laws of certain foreign countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets, such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. We may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, data sets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to prevent the disclosure of our trade secrets to third parties, or if our competitors independently develop any of our trade secrets, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could seriously harm our business.Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation, whether or not resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and result in counterclaims with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights by us. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or are required to incur substantial expenses defending our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.We may become subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs of doing business.We compete in markets where there are a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights, as well as disputes regarding infringement of these rights. In addition, many of the holders of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights have extensive intellectual property portfolios and greater resources than we do to enforce their rights. As compared to our large competitors, our patent portfolio is relatively undeveloped and may not provide a material deterrent to such assertions or provide us with a strong basis to counterclaim or negotiate settlements. Further, to the extent assertions are made against us by entities that hold patents but are not operating companies, our patent portfolio may not provide deterrence because such entities are not concerned with counterclaims. Any intellectual property litigation to which we become a party may require us to do one or more of the following:&#8226;cease selling, licensing, or using products or features that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate, or violate;&#8226;require us to change the name of our products or services;&#8226;make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments, or other costs or damages, including indemnification of third parties;&#8226;obtain a license or enter into a royalty agreement, either of which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, in order to obtain the right to sell or use the relevant intellectual property; or&#8226;redesign the allegedly infringing products to avoid infringement, misappropriation, or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming, or impossible.33Table of ContentsIntellectual property litigation is typically complex, time consuming, and expensive to resolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel. It may also result in adverse publicity, which could harm our reputation and ability to attract or retain employees, customers, or partners. As we grow, we may experience a heightened risk of allegations of intellectual property infringement. An adverse result in any litigation claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If we use open source software inconsistent with our policies and procedures or the license terms applicable to such software, we could be subject to legal expenses, damages, or costly remediation or disruption to our business. We use open source software in our platform and in our professional service engagements. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures in place designed to govern our use of open source software, there is a risk that we may incorporate open source software with onerous licensing terms, including the obligation to make our source code available for others to use or modify without compensation to us, or inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. If we receive an allegation that we have violated an open source license, we may incur significant legal expenses, be subject to damages, be required to redesign our product to remove the open source software or publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code, or be required to comply with onerous license restrictions, all of which could have a material impact on our business. Even in the absence of a claim, if we discover the use of open source software inconsistent with our policies, we could expend significant time and resources to replace the open source software or obtain a commercial license, if available. All of these risks are heightened by the fact that the ownership of open source software can be uncertain, leading to litigation, and many of the licenses applicable to open source software have not been interpreted by courts, and these licenses could be construed to impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. Any use of open source software inconsistent with our policies or licensing terms could harm our business and financial position.Risks Related to Our Tax, Legal, and Regulatory EnvironmentWe are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security, and the failure or perceived failure to comply with these obligations could result in significant fines and liability or otherwise result in substantial harm to our business and prospects.We are subject to data privacy and protection laws, regulations, guidance, external and internal policies and other documentation, industry standards, certifications, and contractual and other obligations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage, use, and other processing of personal information. These obligations are rapidly evolving, extensive, complex, and include inconsistencies and uncertainties. Examples of recent and anticipated developments that have or could impact our business include the following:&#8226;The European Union&#8217;s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the United Kingdom&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation established strict requirements applicable to the handling of personal information. &#8226;The EU has proposed the Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications, which, if adopted, would impose new obligations on using personal information in the context of electronic communications, particularly with respect to online tracking technologies and direct marketing.&#8226;Certain other jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal information transfer laws, such as Brazil and China, which could make it more difficult for us to transfer personal information across jurisdictions (such as transferring or receiving personal or other sensitive information that originates in the EU or China), or to enable our customers to transfer or replicate their data across jurisdictions using our platform. Existing mechanisms that may facilitate cross-border personal information transfers may change or be invalidated. An inability or material limitation on our ability to transfer personal data to the United States or other countries could materially impact our business operations and revenue. 34Table of Contents&#8226;In the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted or proposed data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, and consumer protection laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides increased privacy rights and protections, including the ability of individuals to opt out of specific disclosures of their personal information. Further, as of January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA) has expanded the CCPA and established the California Privacy Protection Agency for purposes of implementing and enforcing the CPRA, which could increase the risk of an enforcement action. Other U.S. states have adopted, or are considering adopting, similar laws.&#8226;Other government bodies have implemented laws and are considering further regulating artificial intelligence and machine learning, which could negatively impact our ability to use these technologies. Further, there is a proposed regulation in Europe related to artificial intelligence that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations related to the use of AI-related systems. We may have to change our business practices to comply with such obligations, which may be difficult, onerous, and costly. &#8226;The certifications we may maintain and the standards that may apply to our business, such as the U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, PCI-DSS, ISO/IEC 27001, HI-TRUST CSF, StateRAMP, among others, are becoming more stringent. These and other similar legal and regulatory developments could contribute to legal and economic uncertainty, increase our exposure to liability, affect how we design, market, and sell our platform, and how we operate our business, how our customers and partners process and share data, how we process and use data, and how we transfer personal data from one jurisdiction to another, any of which could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and/or negatively impact the types of data available on or the demand for our platform. It is possible that new laws may be adopted or existing laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. We may incur substantial costs to comply with such laws and regulations, to meet the demands of our customers relating to their own compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to establish and maintain internal policies, self-certifications, and third-party certifications supporting our compliance programs. Our customers may delegate certain of their GDPR compliance or other privacy law obligations to us, and we may otherwise be required to expend resources to assist our customers with such compliance obligations. Although we endeavor to comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, any actual or perceived non-compliance with such obligations by us or our third-party service providers and sub-processors could result in proceedings, investigations, or claims against us by regulatory authorities, customers, or others, leading to reputational harm, higher liability and indemnity obligations, significant fines, litigation costs, additional reporting requirements or oversight, bans on processing personal information, orders to destroy or not use personal information, limitations in our ability to develop or commercialize our platform, inability to process personal information or operate in certain jurisdictions, and other damages. For example, if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the GDPR, we may be subject to fines of up to EUR 20.0 million or 4% of our worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater, as well as potential data processing restrictions and penalties. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws and other obligations, investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity. In addition, any failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with applicable obligations could result in proceedings against us. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may publish privacy policies and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use, and disclosure of personal information, or other confidential information. Although we endeavor to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation, we or our vendors may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Claims that we have violated individuals&#8217; privacy rights or failed to comply with data protection laws or applicable privacy notices even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.35Table of ContentsWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are subject to the FCPA, U.S. domestic bribery laws, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct business. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. As we increase our international sales, including in China, and sales to the public sector, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market or resell our products and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, there is a risk that our employees, agents, and other third parties with which we do business, including reseller and system integrator partners, will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we expand internationally and into the public sector market, our risks under these laws may increase.Detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.Our platform is subject to U.S. export controls, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and we incorporate encryption technology into our platform. This encryption technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an encryption classification request or self-classification report.Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations administered by various U.S. agencies, including the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control, that prohibit the sale or supply of most products and services to embargoed jurisdictions or sanctioned parties. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control regulations can result in significant fines or penalties and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers.If our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm, as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties.36Table of ContentsAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform in those countries. Changes in our platform or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our platform in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from using our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. From time to time, various governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation, increased export and import controls, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our international operations may subject us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.We are expanding our international operations to better support our growth into international markets. Our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies contemplate future growth in international markets, and consider the functions, risks, and assets of the various entities involved in intercompany transactions. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions pursuant to our intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations. Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws, regulations, or rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. For example, 2017 legislation informally titled the Tax Act significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Recently, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides for a minimum tax equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. In February 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock through a stock repurchase program. We do not expect the excise tax on share repurchase programs to have a material impact on our aggregate tax liability. Many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Commission, have recently proposed, recommended, or (in the case of countries) enacted or otherwise become subject to changes to existing tax laws or new tax laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in the countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. These proposals, recommendations and enactments include changes to the existing framework in respect of income taxes, as well as new types of non-income taxes (such as taxes based on a percentage of revenue or taxes applicable to digital services), which could apply to our business.Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements. We continue to monitor the impact of new global and U.S. legislation on our effective tax rate.37Table of ContentsOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.We have incurred substantial losses during our history, do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and may never achieve profitability. Unused U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 may be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused NOLs expire. Under the Tax Act, as modified by 2020 legislation referred to as the CARES Act, U.S. federal NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such U.S. federal NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of such year&#8217;s taxable income. At the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. As of January&#160;31, 2023, we had U.S. federal, state, and foreign NOL carryforwards of $5.8 billion, $5.1 billion, and $159.0 million, respectively. Of the $5.8 billion U.S. federal NOL carryforwards, $5.7 billion may be carried forward indefinitely with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income, and the remaining $0.1 billion will begin to expire in 2032. The state NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2023. Of the $159.0 million foreign NOL carryforwards, $150.2 million may be carried forward indefinitely, and the remaining $8.8 million will begin to expire in 2027.In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; which is generally defined as one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increasing their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. It is possible that we have experienced or may experience ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. This could limit the amount of NOLs that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. Subsequent ownership changes and changes to the U.S. tax rules in respect of the utilization of NOLs may further affect the limitation in future years. Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable, but the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined.Our effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including:&#8226;changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;&#8226;changes in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them;&#8226;changes to our assessment about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;&#8226;the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; and&#8226;the effects of acquisitions.Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations.Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common StockOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of our common stock may decline.The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:&#8226;actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or results of operations;38Table of Contents&#8226;variance in our actual or projected financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;&#8226;changes in the pricing or consumption of our platform;&#8226;updates to our projected operating and financial results;&#8226;changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business;&#8226;announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions, investments, or new offerings;&#8226;significant data breaches, disruptions to, or other incidents involving our platform;&#8226;our involvement in litigation;&#8226;changes in senior management or key personnel;&#8226;fluctuations in company valuations, particularly valuations of high-growth or cloud companies, perceived to be comparable to us&#8226;the trading volume of our common stock;&#8226;changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market; &#8226;our issuance or repurchase of shares of our common stock; and&#8226;general political, social, economic, and market conditions.Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may also negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In addition, technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial expenses and divert our management&#8217;s attention.Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Many of our stockholders who held our capital stock prior to completion of our IPO have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity they hold based upon the price at which shares were sold in our IPO, and therefore, they may take steps to sell their shares or otherwise secure the unrecognized gains on those shares. We are unable to predict the timing of or the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.The shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and restricted stock unit awards (RSUs) under our equity incentive plans, and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, will become eligible for sale in the public market upon issuance, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.Further, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.39Table of ContentsOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.We expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we have and may continue to acquire or make investments in companies, products, or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.We may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our stock repurchase program, and any failure to repurchase our common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock price.In February 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock through a stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program expires in March 2025.The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us, or our stock price.The existence of our stock repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchase shares, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the program. Repurchasing our common stock reduces the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments, other business opportunities, and other general corporate projects, and we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of any stock repurchase program.If securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, the market price or trading volume of our common stock could decline.The market price and trading volume of our common stock is heavily influenced by the way analysts interpret our financial information and other disclosures. We do not have control over these analysts. If securities analysts or industry analysts cease coverage of us, our stock price would be negatively affected. If securities or industry analysts downgrade our common stock or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price would likely decline. Further, investors and analysts may not understand how our consumption-based business model differs from a subscription-based business model. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, publish inaccurate research about our business, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price to decline and could decrease the trading volume of our common stock.We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the ability of the holders of our common stock to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, holders of our common stock may need to rely on sales of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.40Table of ContentsWe incur significant costs operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including those related to climate change and other environmental, social, and governance focused disclosures, are creating uncertainty for public companies. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management&#8217;s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed. Failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the specific timing of such costs.As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts. We have established an internal audit group, and as we continue to grow, we will hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and update the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404.During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.41Table of ContentsAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, and limit the market price of our common stock.Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:&#8226;authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;&#8226;require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;&#8226;specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, or our Chief Executive Officer;&#8226;establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;&#8226;establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;&#8226;prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;&#8226;provide that our directors may only be removed for cause;&#8226;provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and&#8226;require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any &#8220;interested&#8221; stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an &#8220;interested&#8221; stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that holders of our common stock would receive a premium for their shares of our common stock in an acquisition.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which will restrict our stockholders&#8217; ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. 42Table of ContentsFurthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESWe are a Delaware corporation with a globally distributed workforce. We recruit and hire employees in jurisdictions around the world based on a range of factors, including the available talent pool, the type of work being performed, the relative cost of labor, regulatory requirements and costs, and other considerations. The majority of our workforce began working remotely in April 2020 and although some of our employees continue to work remotely following the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our workforce has returned to physical offices. We currently lease offices in the United States, including in Atlanta, Georgia; Bellevue, Washington; Boston, Massachusetts; Bozeman, Montana; Denver, Colorado; Dublin, California; San Mateo, California; and Washington, D.C. We also have offices in multiple locations in Canada, Europe, and the APJ and EMEA regions. All of our offices are leased, and we do not own any real property. While we believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs, we intend to expand our facilities in the future as we continue to add employees around the world. We believe that suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our future growth.ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSFrom time to time, we have been and will continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, claims from third parties asserting, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners, and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.ITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#8217;S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESMarket Price of Our Class A Common StockOur Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol &#8220;SNOW&#8221; and began trading on September 16, 2020. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our Class A common stock. Holders of RecordAs of March&#160;1, 2023, there were 157 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock. The actual number of holders of our Class A common stock is greater than the number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers or other nominees. The number of holders of record presented here also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities.On March 1, 2021, all shares of our then-outstanding Class B common stock were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. See Note 12, &#8220;Equity,&#8221; in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.Dividend PolicyWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation PlansThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the definitive Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which will be filed with the SEC no later than 120 days after January&#160;31, 2023.Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity SecuritiesIn connection with our acquisition of the outstanding capital stock of Streamlit, Inc. in March 2022, we agreed to issue 2.3 million shares of our common stock as consideration (Equity Consideration), all of which have been issued. A portion of the Equity Consideration that was issued to Streamlit&#8217;s founders (Founder Shares) are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the Founder Shares vest over three years, subject to each founder&#8217;s continued employment with Snowflake or its affiliates. See Note 12, &#8220;Equity,&#8221; in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.These issuances were made in reliance on one or more of the following exemptions or exclusions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act): Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.Use of ProceedsOn September 18, 2020, we closed our IPO of 32.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at an offering price of $120.00 per share, including 4.2 million shares pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $3.7 billion, net of the underwriting discounts. All of the shares issued and sold in our IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-248280), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 15, 2020. We incurred offering expenses of approximately $0.3 million. Immediately subsequent to the closing of our IPO, each of Salesforce Ventures LLC and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. purchased from us approximately 2.1 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price per share equal to the IPO price of $120.00 per share in two concurrent private placements. We received aggregate proceeds of $500.0 million and did not pay underwriting discounts with respect to the shares of Class A common stock that were sold in these private placements.There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO as described in our Final Prospectus for our IPO dated as of September 15, 2020 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on September 16, 2020.Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesNone.Stock Performance GraphThis performance graph shall not be deemed &#8220;soliciting material&#8221; or to be &#8220;filed&#8221; with the SEC, for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act.The graph below shows the cumulative total return to our stockholders between September 16, 2020 (the date that our Class A common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange) through January&#160;31, 2023 in comparison to the SP 500 Index and the SP 500 Information Technology Index.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion, particularly information with respect to our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading &#8220;Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should review the disclosure under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is included in the section titled &#8220;Key Business Metrics.&#8221; This non-GAAP financial measure is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP information and the GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation included in the section titled &#8220;Key Business Metrics&#8212;Free Cash Flow,&#8221; to more fully understand our business.Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to &#8220;Snowflake,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or similar terms refer to Snowflake Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2022 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2021 can be found in &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2022.OverviewWe believe in a data connected world where organizations have seamless access to explore, share, and unlock the value of data. To realize this vision, we deliver the Data Cloud, a network where Snowflake customers, partners, developers, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways. Our platform is the innovative technology that powers the Data Cloud, enabling customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data applications, and share data and data products. We provide our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use. Our cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable but logically integrated layers across compute, storage, and cloud services. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases with minimal latency. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data to create a unified data record. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case&#8217;s performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 38 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are generally interconnected to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a consistent, global user experience.We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from fees charged to our customers based on the compute, storage, and data transfer resources consumed on our platform as a single, integrated offering. For compute resources, consumption fees are based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For storage resources, consumption fees are based on the average terabytes per month of all of the customer&#8217;s data stored in our platform. For data transfer resources, consumption fees are based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed.45Table of ContentsOur customers typically enter into capacity arrangements with a term of one to four years, or consume our platform under on-demand arrangements in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. Consumption for most customers accelerates from the beginning of their usage to the end of their contract terms and often exceeds their initial capacity commitment amounts. When this occurs, our customers have the option to amend their existing agreement with us to purchase additional capacity or request early renewals. When a customer&#8217;s consumption during the contract term does not exceed its capacity commitment amount, it may have the option to roll over any unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity. For these reasons, we believe our deferred revenue is not a meaningful indicator of future revenue that will be recognized in any given time period.Our go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving continued use of our platform for existing customers. We primarily focus our selling efforts on large organizations and primarily sell our platform through a direct sales force, which targets technical and business leaders who are adopting a cloud strategy and leveraging data to improve their business performance. Our sales force is comprised of sales development, inside sales, and field sales personnel and is segmented by the industry, size, and region of prospective customers. Once our platform has been adopted, we focus on increasing the migration of additional customer workloads to our platform to drive increased consumption, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate of 158% and 177% as of January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See the section titled &#8220;Key Business Metrics&#8221; for a definition of net revenue retention rate.Our platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. As of January&#160;31, 2023, we had 7,828 total customers, increasing from 5,967 customers as of January&#160;31, 2022. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our total customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. Our platform has been adopted by many of the world&#8217;s largest organizations that view Snowflake as a key strategic partner in their cloud and data transformation initiatives. As of January&#160;31, 2023, our customers included 573 of the Forbes Global 2000, based on the 2022 Forbes Global 2000 list, and those customers contributed approximately 41% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the Global 2000 list by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on January 31. For example, references to fiscal 2023 refer to the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023.Impact of Macroeconomic ConditionsOur business and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions, including higher inflation, higher interest rates, and fluctuations or volatility in capital markets or foreign currency exchange rates, which are causing customers to optimize consumption, rationalize budgets, and prioritize cash flow management (including through shortened contract duration). We are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of general macroeconomic conditions across our business. For additional details, see the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;Stock Repurchase ProgramIn February 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program is funded using our working capital and will expire in March 2025.The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.46Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsOn March 31, 2022, we acquired all outstanding stock of Streamlit, Inc. (Streamlit), a privately-held company which provides an open-source framework for creating and deploying data applications. The acquisition date fair value of the purchase consideration was $650.8 million, which was comprised of $211.8 million in cash and 1.9 million shares of our common stock valued at $438.9 million as of the acquisition date. In addition, we issued to Streamlit&#8217;s three founders a total of 0.4 million shares of our common stock in exchange for a portion of their Streamlit stock. These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over three years, subject to each founder&#8217;s continued employment with us. The $93.7 million fair value of these shares are accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of three years.On September 23, 2022, we acquired all outstanding stock of Applica Sp. z.o.o. (Applica), a privately-held company which provides an artificial intelligence platform for document understanding, for $174.7 million in cash.The results of operations of these business combinations have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. See Note 7, &#8220;Business Combinations,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding these business combinations.Key Factors Affecting Our PerformanceAdoption of our Platform&#160;and Expansion of the Data CloudOur future success depends in large part on the market adoption of our platform. While we see growing demand for our platform, particularly from large enterprises, many of these organizations have invested substantial technical, financial, and personnel resources in their legacy database products or big data offerings, despite their inherent limitations. While this makes it difficult to predict customer adoption rates and future demand, we believe that the benefits of our platform put us in a strong position to capture the significant market opportunity ahead.Our platform powers the Data Cloud, a network of data providers, data consumers, and data application developers that enables our customers to securely share, monetize, and acquire live data sets and data products. The Data Cloud includes access to Snowflake Marketplace, through which customers can access or acquire third-party data sets and other data products. Our future growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to increase consumption of our platform by building and expanding the Data Cloud.Expanding Within our Existing Customer BaseOur large base of customers represents a significant opportunity for further consumption of our platform. While we have seen an increase in the number of customers that have contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months, we believe that there is a substantial opportunity to continue growing these customers further, as well as continuing to expand the usage of our platform within our other existing customers. We plan to continue investing to encourage increased consumption and adoption of new use cases among our existing customers, particularly large enterprises.47Table of ContentsOnce deployed, our customers often expand their use of our platform more broadly within the enterprise and across their ecosystem of customers and partners as they migrate more data to the public cloud, identify new use cases, and realize the benefits of our platform and the Data Cloud. However, because we generally recognize product revenue on consumption and not ratably over the term of the contract, we do not have visibility into the timing of revenue recognition from any particular customer. In any given period, there is a risk that customer consumption of our platform will be slower than we expect, including in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions, which may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. New software releases or hardware improvements, like better storage compression and cloud infrastructure processor improvements, may make our platform more efficient, enabling customers to consume fewer compute, storage, and data transfer resources to accomplish the same workloads. To the extent these improvements do not result in an offsetting increase in new workloads, we may experience lower revenue. In addition, we have recently seen, and may continue to see, our newer customers increase their consumption of our platform at a slower pace than our more tenured customers. Our ability to increase usage of our platform by, and sell additional contracted capacity to, existing customers, and, in particular, large enterprise customers, will depend on a number of factors, including our customers&#8217; satisfaction with our platform, competition, pricing, economic conditions, overall changes in our customers&#8217; spending levels, the effectiveness of our and our partners&#8217; efforts to help our customers realize the benefits of our platform, and the extent to which customers migrate new workloads to our platform over time.Acquiring New CustomersWe believe there is a substantial opportunity to further grow our customer base by continuing to make significant investments in sales and marketing and brand awareness. Our ability to attract new customers will depend on a number of factors, including our success in recruiting and scaling our sales and marketing organization, competitive dynamics in our target markets, changes in our customers&#8217; spending in response to market uncertainty, and our ability to build and maintain partner relationships, including with global system integrators, resellers, and technology partners. We intend to continue expanding our direct sales force, with a focus on specific industries and increasing sales to large organizations. While our platform is built for organizations of all sizes, we focus our selling efforts on large enterprise customers and customers with vast amounts of data, and providing industry-specific solutions. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force to focus on large enterprises and specific industries if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel; if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time; or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective. Investing in Growth and Scaling our BusinessWe are focused on our long-term revenue potential. We believe that our market opportunity is large, and we will continue to invest significantly in scaling across all organizational functions, with a focus on research and development, and sales and marketing, in order to grow our operations both domestically and internationally. We have a history of introducing successful new features and capabilities on our platform, and we intend to continue to invest heavily to grow our business to take advantage of our expansive market opportunity while also focusing on profitability and cash flow. Key Business MetricsWe monitor the key business metrics set forth below to help us evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. The calculation of the key business metrics discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts, or investors.The following tables present a summary of key business metrics for the periods presented:Fiscal Year Ended January 31,202320222021Product revenue (in millions)$1,938.8&#160;$1,140.5&#160;$553.8&#160;Free cash flow (non-GAAP) (in millions)(1)(2)$496.5&#160;$81.2&#160;$(85.7)48Table of ContentsJanuary 31, 2023January 31, 2022January 31, 2021Customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million(3)330&#160;184&#160;79&#160;Net revenue retention rate(3)158&#160;%177&#160;%168&#160;%Forbes Global 2000 customers(3)573&#160;492&#160;403&#160;Remaining performance obligations (in millions)(4)$3,660.5&#160;$2,646.5&#160;$1,332.8&#160;________________(1)Free cash flow for the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 included the effect of $23.9 million, $68.6 million, and $14.1 million, respectively, in the net cash paid on payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions. See the section titled &#8220;Free Cash Flow&#8221; for a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.(2)Cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to the net share settlement of equity awards, which were $184.6 million for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023, are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an effect on the calculation of free cash flow. No equity awards were net settled prior to the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023. (3)Historical numbers for (i) customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, (ii) net revenue retention rate, and (iii) Forbes Global 2000 customers reflect any adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. In addition, our Forbes Global 2000 customer count reflects adjustments for&#160;annual updates to the Forbes Global 2000 list by Forbes.(4)As of January&#160;31, 2023, our remaining performance obligations were approximately $3.7 billion, of which we expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the twelve months ending January 31, 2024 based on historical customer consumption patterns. The weighted-average remaining life of our capacity contracts was 2.0 years as of January&#160;31, 2023. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition are generally dependent upon customers' future consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers&#8217; discretion and can extend beyond the original contract term in cases where customers are permitted to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. In addition, our historical customer consumption patterns are not necessarily indicative of future results.Product RevenueProduct revenue is a key metric for us because we recognize revenue based on platform consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers&#8217; discretion, and not based on the amount and duration of contract terms. Product revenue is primarily derived from the consumption of compute, storage, and data transfer resources, which are consumed by customers on our platform as a single, integrated offering. Customers have the flexibility to consume more than their contracted capacity during the contract term and may have the ability to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. Our consumption-based business model distinguishes us from subscription-based software companies that generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract term and may not permit rollover. Because customers have flexibility in the timing of their consumption, which can exceed their contracted capacity or extend beyond the original contract term in many cases, the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and the value derived from our platform. While customer use of our platform in any period is not necessarily indicative of future use, we estimate future revenue using predictive models based on customers&#8217; historical usage to plan and determine financial forecasts. Product revenue excludes our professional services and other revenue, which has been less than 10% of revenue for each of the periods presented.Customers with Trailing 12-Month Product Revenue Greater than $1 MillionLarge customer relationships lead to scale and operating leverage in our business model. Compared with smaller customers, large customers present a greater opportunity for us to sell additional capacity because they have larger budgets, a wider range of potential use cases, and greater potential for migrating new workloads to our platform over time. As a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract large enterprises to our platform, we count the number of customers under capacity arrangements that contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months. For purposes of determining our customer count, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers. We do not include customers that consume our platform only under on-demand arrangements for purposes of determining our customer count. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.49Table of ContentsNet Revenue Retention RateWe believe the growth in use of our platform by our existing customers is an important measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. We monitor our dollar-based net revenue retention rate to measure this growth. To calculate this metric, we first specify a measurement period consisting of the trailing two years from our current period end. Next, we define as our measurement cohort the population of customers under capacity contracts that used our platform at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period. Starting with the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2021, the cohorts used to calculate net revenue retention rate include end-customers under a reseller arrangement. Although the impact is not material, we have adjusted all prior periods presented to reflect this inclusion. We then calculate our net revenue retention rate as the quotient obtained by dividing our product revenue from this cohort in the second year of the measurement period by our product revenue from this cohort in the first year of the measurement period. Any customer in the cohort that did not use our platform in the second year remains in the calculation and contributes zero product revenue in the second year. Our net revenue retention rate is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our net revenue retention rate for historical periods reflecting these adjustments. Since we will continue to attribute the historical product revenue to the consolidated contract, consolidation of capacity contracts within a customer&#8217;s organization typically will not impact our net revenue retention rate unless one of those customers was not a customer at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period. We expect our net revenue retention rate to decrease over the long-term as customers that have consumed our platform for an extended period of time become a larger portion of both our overall customer base and our product revenue that we use to calculate net revenue retention rate, and as their consumption growth primarily relates to existing use cases rather than new use cases. In addition, we have recently seen, and may continue to see, our newer customers increase their consumption of our platform at a slower pace than our more tenured customers, which may negatively impact our net revenue retention rate in future periods.Forbes Global 2000 Customers We believe that the number of Forbes Global 2000 customers is an important indicator of the growth of our business and future revenue trends as we focus our selling efforts on large enterprise customers and customers with vast amounts of data. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is a subset of our customer count based on the 2022 Forbes Global 2000 list. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the list by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.Remaining Performance ObligationsRemaining performance obligations (RPO) represent the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO excludes performance obligations from on-demand arrangements and certain time and materials contracts that are billed in arrears. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates. RPO is not necessarily indicative of future product revenue growth because it does not account for the timing of customers&#8217; consumption or their consumption of more than their contracted capacity. Moreover, RPO is influenced by a number of factors, including the timing and size of renewals, the timing and size of purchases of additional capacity, average contract terms, seasonality, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the extent to which customers are permitted to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. Due to these factors, it is important to review RPO in conjunction with product revenue and other financial metrics disclosed elsewhere herein. 50Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowWe define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software development costs. Cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to the net share settlement of equity awards are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an effect on the calculation of free cash flow. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our core business operations.The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented (in millions):Fiscal Year Ended January 31,202320222021Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$545.6&#160;$110.2&#160;$(45.4)Less: purchases of property and equipment(25.1)(16.2)(35.0)Less: capitalized internal-use software development costs(24.0)(12.8)(5.3)Free cash flow (non-GAAP)(1)(2)$496.5&#160;$81.2&#160;$(85.7)________________(1)Free cash flow for the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 included the effect of $23.9 million, $68.6 million, and $14.1 million, respectively, in the net cash paid on payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions.(2)Cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to the net share settlement of equity awards, which were $184.6 million for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023, are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an effect on the calculation of free cash flow. No equity awards were net settled prior to the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023.Historically, we have received a higher volume of orders from new and existing customers in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. As a result, we have historically seen higher free cash flow in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year.51Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenueWe deliver our platform over the internet as a service. Customers choose to consume our platform under either capacity arrangements, in which they commit to a certain amount of consumption at specified prices, or under on-demand arrangements, in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. Under capacity arrangements, from which a majority of our revenue is derived, we typically bill our customers annually in advance of their consumption. However, in future periods, we expect to see an increase in capacity contracts providing for quarterly upfront billings and monthly in arrears billings as our customers increasingly want to align consumption and timing of payments. Revenue from on-demand arrangements typically relates to initial consumption as part of customer onboarding and, to a lesser extent, overage consumption beyond a customer&#8217;s contracted usage amount or following the expiration of a customer&#8217;s contract. Revenue from on-demand arrangements represented approximately 2%, 3%, and 4% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.We recognize revenue as customers consume compute, storage, and data transfer resources under either of these arrangements. In limited instances, customers pay an annual deployment fee to gain access to a dedicated instance of a virtual private deployment. We recognize the deployment fee ratably over the contract term. Such deployment revenue represented less than 1% of our revenue for all periods presented.Our customer contracts for capacity typically have a term of one to four years. The weighted-average term of capacity contracts entered into during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 is 2.2 years. To the extent our customers enter into such contracts and either consume our platform in excess of their capacity commitments or continue to use our platform after expiration of the contract term, they are charged for their incremental consumption. In many cases, our customer contracts permit customers to roll over any unused capacity to a subsequent order, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity. For those customers who do not have a capacity arrangement, our on-demand arrangements generally have a monthly stated contract term and can be terminated at any time by either the customer or us.We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from fees charged to our customers based on the compute, storage, and data transfer resources consumed on our platform as a single, integrated offering. We do not make any one of these resources available for consumption without the others. Instead, each of compute, storage, and data transfer work together to drive consumption on our platform. For compute resources, consumption is based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For storage resources, consumption for a given customer is based on the average terabytes per month of all of such customer&#8217;s data stored in our platform. For data transfer resources, consumption is based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed.Because customers have flexibility in their consumption, and we generally recognize revenue on consumption and not ratably over the term of the contract, we do not have the visibility into the timing of revenue recognition from any particular customer contract that typical subscription-based software companies may have. As our customer base grows, we expect our ability to forecast customer consumption in the aggregate to improve. However, in any given period, there is a risk that customers will consume our platform more slowly than we expect, including in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions, which may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. For example, we have recently seen, and may continue to see, our newer customers increase their consumption of our platform at a slower pace than our more tenured customers. In addition, new software releases or hardware improvements, like better storage compression and cloud infrastructure processor improvements, may make our platform more efficient, enabling customers to consume fewer compute, storage, and data transfer resources to accomplish the same workloads. To the extent these improvements do not result in an offsetting increase in new workloads, we may experience lower revenue.Our revenue also includes professional services and other revenue, which consists primarily of consulting, technical solution services, and training related to our platform. Our professional services revenue is recognized over time based on input measures, including time and materials costs incurred relative to total costs, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract deliverables, when applicable. Other revenue consists primarily of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes.52Table of ContentsAllocation of Overhead CostsOverhead costs that are not substantially dedicated for use by a specific functional group are allocated based on headcount. Such costs include costs associated with office facilities, depreciation of property and equipment, information technology (IT) and general recruiting related expenses and other expenses, such as software and subscription services.Cost of RevenueCost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of professional services and other revenue. Cost of revenue also includes allocated overhead costs.Cost of product revenue. Cost of product revenue consists primarily of (i) third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in connection with our customers&#8217; use of our platform and the deployment and maintenance of our platform on public clouds, including different regional deployments, and (ii) personnel-related costs associated with customer support and maintaining service availability and security of our platform, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We periodically receive credits from third-party cloud providers that are recorded as a reduction to the third-party cloud infrastructure expenses. Cost of product revenue also includes amortization of internal-use software development costs, amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets, and expenses associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by our customer support team and our engineering team responsible for maintaining our platform.Cost of professional services and other revenue. Cost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, and costs of contracted third-party partners and software tools.We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure and our customer support and professional services organizations to support the growth of our business. Some of these investments, including certain support costs and costs of expanding our business internationally, are incurred in advance of generating revenue, and either the failure to generate anticipated revenue or fluctuations in the timing of revenue could affect our gross margin from period to period. Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and sales commissions. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions and draws paid to our sales force and certain referral fees paid to third parties, including amortization of deferred commissions. A portion of the sales commissions paid to the sales force is earned based on the rate of the customers&#8217; consumption of our platform, and a portion of the commissions paid to the sales force is earned upon the origination of the customer contracts. Sales commissions tied to customers&#8217; consumption are expensed in the same period as they are earned. Sales commissions and referral fees earned upon the origination of the new customer or customer expansion contracts are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit that we determined to be five years. Sales and marketing expenses also include advertising costs and other expenses associated with our sales, marketing and business development programs, including Summit, our annual user conference, offset by proceeds from such conferences and programs. In addition, sales and marketing expenses are comprised of travel-related expenses, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our sales and marketing organizations, amortization of an acquired developer community intangible asset, and outside services contracted for sales and marketing purposes. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense for the foreseeable future as we grow our business. However, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and the extent of these expenses.53Table of ContentsResearch and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses also include contractor or professional services fees, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform, and expenses associated with computer equipment, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our research and development organization. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, particularly as we incur additional costs related to continued investments in our platform. However, we expect that our research and development expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and the extent of these expenses. In addition, research and development expenses that qualify as internal-use software development costs are capitalized, the amount of which may fluctuate significantly from period to period.General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, facilities, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses also include external legal, accounting, and other professional services fees, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our general and administrative functions, insurance, unallocated lease costs associated with unused office facilities to accommodate planned headcount growth, and other corporate expenses. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows but will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and the extent of these expenses.Interest IncomeInterest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts related to our available-for-sale marketable debt securities, net of associated fees.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net consists primarily of (i) unrealized gains (losses) on our strategic investments in equity securities, and (ii) the effect of exchange rates on our foreign&#160;currency-denominated&#160;asset and liability balances.Provision for (Benefit from) Income TaxesProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign and U.S. federal and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snowflake Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a majority-owned subsidiary in which we have a controlling financial interest. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the net income (loss) of our majority-owned subsidiary attributed to noncontrolling interest using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method. See Note 2, &#8220;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.54Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated (in thousands):Fiscal Year Ended January 31,202320222021Revenue$2,065,659&#160;$1,219,327&#160;$592,049&#160;Cost of revenue(1)717,540&#160;458,433&#160;242,588&#160;Gross profit1,348,119&#160;760,894&#160;349,461&#160;Operating expenses(1):Sales and marketing1,106,507&#160;743,965&#160;479,317&#160;Research and development788,058&#160;466,932&#160;237,946&#160;General and administrative295,821&#160;265,033&#160;176,135&#160;Total operating expenses2,190,386&#160;1,475,930&#160;893,398&#160;Operating loss(842,267)(715,036)(543,937)Interest income73,839&#160;9,129&#160;7,507&#160;Other income (expense), net(47,565)28,947&#160;(610)Loss before income taxes(815,993)(676,960)(537,040)Provision for (benefit from) income taxes(18,467)2,988&#160;2,062&#160;Net loss(797,526)(679,948)(539,102)Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest(821)&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Net loss attributable to Snowflake Inc.$(796,705)$(679,948)$(539,102)________________(1)Includes stock-based compensation as follows (in thousands):Fiscal Year Ended January 31,202320222021Cost of revenue$106,302&#160;$87,336&#160;$33,642&#160;Sales and marketing246,811&#160;185,970&#160;97,879&#160;Research and development407,524&#160;232,867&#160;99,223&#160;General and administrative100,896&#160;98,922&#160;70,697&#160;Total stock-based compensation$861,533&#160;$605,095&#160;$301,441&#160;The increase in stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, was primarily attributable to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock unit awards (RSUs) granted prior to our Initial Public Offering (IPO). RSUs granted prior to our IPO have both a service-based and a performance-based vesting condition and, as a result of the performance-based vesting condition being satisfied in connection with our IPO, we recognized stock-based compensation associated with such RSUs using an accelerated attribution method.As of January&#160;31, 2023, total compensation cost related to unvested equity awards not yet recognized was $2.4 billion, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.

Such customers represented approximately 62% and 56% of our product revenue for the trailing 12 months ended January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Within these customers, we had 59 and 19 customers with product revenue of greater than $5 million and $10 million, respectively, for the trailing 12 months ended January&#160;31, 2023. Approximately 96% and 93% of our revenue was derived from existing customers under capacity arrangements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue derived from new customers under capacity arrangements represented approximately 2% and 4% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remainder was driven by on-demand arrangements. The preceding historical metrics reflect any adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. For purposes of determining revenue derived from (i) customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, (ii) new customers, and (iii) existing customers, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers.Professional services and other revenue increased $48.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, as we continued to expand our professional services organization to help our customers further realize the benefits of our platform.Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit (Loss), and Gross MarginFiscal Year Ended January 31,20232022% Change(dollars in thousands)Cost of revenue:Product$547,547$347,81757%Professional services and other169,993110,61654%Total cost of revenue$717,540$458,43357%Gross profit (loss):Product$1,391,236$792,65276%Professional services and other(43,117)(31,758)36%Total gross profit$1,348,119$760,89477%Gross margin:Product72%70%Professional services and other(34%)(40%)Total gross margin65%62%Headcount (at period end)Product373243Professional services and other488348Total headcount861591Cost of product revenue increased $199.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $156.9 million in third-party cloud infrastructure expenses as a result of increased customer consumption. Personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs also increased $28.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees. The remaining increase in cost of product revenue was primarily driven by an increase of $7.6 million in amortization of internal-use software development costs and acquired developed technology intangible assets.57Table of ContentsOur product gross margin was 72% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to 70% for the prior fiscal year, primarily due to (i) increased cost efficiency as a result of cloud infrastructure processor improvements, (ii) an increased percentage of revenue from consumption of higher-priced editions of our platform, (iii) increased scale across our cloud infrastructure regions, and (iv) higher volume-based discounts for our purchases of third-party cloud infrastructure. In addition, the year-over-year increase in our product gross margin was driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation as a percentage of product revenue. While we expect our product gross margin to remain relatively flat for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024, a number of factors could hinder any improvement in our product gross margin, including (i) fluctuations in the mix and timing of customers' consumption, which is inherently variable at our customers' discretion, (ii) whether or not a customer contracts with us through our marketplace listings, (iii) our discounting practices, including as a result of changes to the competitive environment, and (iv) the extent of our investments in our operations, including performance improvements that may make our platform or the underlying cloud infrastructure more efficient.Cost of professional services and other revenue increased $59.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $48.3 million in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs, as a result of increased headcount and overall costs to support the growth in our business, and increased stock-based compensation primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees. Costs associated with contracted third-party partners, primarily related to customer implementations and migrations from legacy solutions, also increased $9.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of growth in our business.Professional services and other gross margin improved for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreased stock-based compensation as a percentage of professional services and other revenue. We do not believe the year-over-year changes in professional services and other gross margins are meaningful given that we are continuing to scale our professional services organization and our professional services and other revenue represents a small percentage of our revenue.Sales and MarketingFiscal Year Ended January 31,20232022% Change(dollars in thousands)Sales and marketing$1,106,507&#160;$743,965&#160;49%Percentage of revenue54&#160;%61&#160;%Headcount (at period end)2,738&#160;1,891&#160;Sales and marketing expenses increased $362.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $232.5 million in personnel-related costs (excluding commission expenses) and allocated overhead costs, as a result of increased headcount, stock-based compensation, and overall costs to support the growth in our business. The increase in personnel-related costs included a $60.8 million increase in stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation related to RSUs granted prior to our IPO. See Note 12, &#8220;Equity,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Expenses associated with sales commissions and draws paid to our sales force and certain referral fees paid to third parties, including amortization of deferred commissions, increased $33.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increases in customers&#8217; consumption of our platform and in the annualized contract value of our customer contracts.Advertising costs and other expenses associated with our sales, marketing and business development programs also increased $39.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by increased expenses related to in-person sales and marketing events and user conferences, including Summit, our annual user conference which was held virtually in the prior year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, net of associated proceeds. As a result of our in-person sales and marketing events and user conferences as well as the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions, travel-related expenses also increased $17.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year.58Table of ContentsIn addition, sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 included $25.2 million of amortization of an acquired developer community intangible asset as a result of the Streamlit business combination completed in March 2022.Research and DevelopmentFiscal Year Ended January 31,20232022% Change(dollars in thousands)Research and development$788,058&#160;$466,932&#160;69%Percentage of revenue38&#160;%38&#160;%Headcount (at period end)1,378&#160;788&#160;Research and development expenses increased $321.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $279.9 million in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs, as a result of increased stock-based compensation, headcount, and overall costs to support the growth in our business. The increase in personnel-related costs included $174.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, primarily related to additional equity awards granted to existing and new employees and the post-combination stock-based compensation related to the Streamlit business combination, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation related to RSUs granted prior to our IPO. See Note 12, &#8220;Equity,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. The remaining increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by an increase of $22.8 million in third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our platform.General and AdministrativeFiscal Year Ended January 31,20232022% Change(dollars in thousands)General and administrative$295,821&#160;$265,033&#160;12%Percentage of revenue14&#160;%22&#160;%Headcount (at period end)907&#160;722&#160;General and administrative expenses increased $30.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase of $14.0 million in outside services mainly as a result of increased legal fees related to acquisitions. Unallocated lease costs, which are associated with unused office facilities to accommodate planned headcount growth, also increased $4.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased insurance expenses and increased other corporate expenses to support the normal course of operations and our continued growth.Interest IncomeFiscal Year Ended January 31,20232022% Change(dollars in thousands)Interest income$73,839$9,129709%Interest income increased $64.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to higher yields on our investments in available-for-sale marketable debt securities as a result of increased interest rates.59Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), NetFiscal Year Ended January 31,20232022% Change(dollars in thousands)Net unrealized gains (losses) on strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities:Upward adjustments$4,125$32,975(87%)Impairments(38,036)&#8212;NMNet unrealized losses on strategic investments in marketable equity securities(12,524)(5,354)134%Other(1,130)1,326(185%)Other income (expense), net$(47,565)$28,947(264%)NM - Not meaningful.Other income (expense), net decreased $76.5 million for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to (i) impairments recorded on our strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities, (ii) a decrease in upward adjustments recorded on our strategic investments in non-marketable equity securities, and (iii) increased net unrealized losses recorded on our strategic investments in marketable equity securities.

The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction&#8217;s individual tax rates, laws on the timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Our effective tax rate might fluctuate significantly and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than forecasted in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than forecasted in countries that have higher statutory rates.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of January&#160;31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments totaling $5.1 billion. Our investments primarily consist of corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, certificates of deposit, and money market funds.As of January&#160;31, 2023, our RPO was $3.7 billion. Our RPO represents the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, which are not recorded on the balance sheet. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates.60Table of ContentsSince inception, we have financed operations primarily through proceeds received from sales of equity securities and payments received from our customers. Our IPO resulted in aggregate net proceeds of $3.7 billion, after underwriting discounts of $121.7 million. We also received aggregate proceeds of $500.0 million related to certain concurrent private placements, and did not pay any underwriting discounts or commissions with respect to the shares that were sold in these private placements. Our primary uses of cash include personnel-related expenses, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, sales and marketing expenses, overhead costs, and acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time. As of January&#160;31, 2023, our material cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments relate primarily to (i) third-party cloud infrastructure agreements, (ii) operating leases for office facilities, and (iii) subscription arrangements used to facilitate our operations at the enterprise level. These agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. In January 2023, we amended one of our third-party cloud infrastructure agreements effective February 1, 2023. Under the amended agreement, we have committed to spend an aggregate of at least $2.5 billion from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028 on cloud infrastructure services ($350.0 million in fiscal 2024, $450.0 million in fiscal 2025, $500.0 million in fiscal 2026, $550.0 million in fiscal 2027, and $650.0 million in fiscal 2028). We are required to pay the difference if we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any fiscal year, and such payment can be applied to qualifying expenditures for cloud infrastructure services during the term of the amended agreement. For more information regarding our contractual obligations and commitments as of January&#160;31, 2023, see Note 10, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our long-term purchase commitments may be satisfied earlier than the payment periods presented as we continue to grow and scale our business.On February&#160;10, 2023, we acquired (i) all outstanding stock of Mountain US Corporation (f/k/a Mobilize.net Corporation), a privately-held company which provides a premier suite of tools for efficiently migrating databases to the Data Cloud, for approximately $67&#160;million in cash, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, and (ii) all outstanding stock of LeapYear Technologies, Inc., a privately-held company which provides a differential privacy platform, for approximately $59&#160;million in cash, net of cash and restricted cash acquired.In February 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program is funded using our working capital and will expire in March 2025. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, as well as cash flows expected to be generated by our operations, will be sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time, and authorized stock repurchases, for the next 12 months and beyond. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, expenditures related to our headcount growth, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the price at which we are able to purchase public cloud capacity, expenses associated with our international expansion, the introduction of platform enhancements, and the continuing market adoption of our platform. We may continue to enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. We may, as a result of those arrangements or the general expansion of our business, be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.61Table of ContentsThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):Fiscal Year Ended January 31,202320222021Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$545,639&#160;$110,179&#160;$(45,417)Net cash used in investing activities$(597,885)$(20,800)$(4,036,645)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(92,624)$178,198&#160;$4,775,290&#160;Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, primarily consisting of (i) stock-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized, (ii) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of acquired intangible assets, (iii) amortization of deferred commissions, (iv) net unrealized gains or losses on strategic investments in equity securities, (v) amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, (vi) net amortization (accretion) of premiums (discounts) on investments, and (vii) deferred income tax benefit or expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities during each period.For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $545.6 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $797.5 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $1.1 billion, and net cash inflows of $289.5 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of the effects of business combinations. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 were (i) a $514.3 million increase in deferred revenue due to invoicing for prepaid capacity agreements outpacing revenue recognition, and (ii) a $74.5 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to increased headcount and growth in our business, partially offset by (a) a $167.0 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to growth in our business, (b) a $95.1 million increase in deferred commissions earned upon the origination of customer contracts, and (c) a $42.3 million decrease in operating lease liabilities due to payments related to our operating lease obligations.For the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $110.2 million, primarily consisting of our net loss of $679.9 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $721.7 million, and net cash inflows of $68.4 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $435.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase of $954.1 million in cash collected from customers resulting from increased sales. This was partially offset by increased expenditures due to an increase in headcount and growth in our business. We expect to continue to generate positive net cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was $597.9 million, primarily as a result of (i) an aggregate of $362.6 million in cash paid for Streamlit, Applica and other business combinations, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, (ii) $185.4 million in net purchases of investments, (iii) $25.1 million in purchases of property and equipment, and (iv) $24.0 million in capitalized internal-use software development costs.Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2022 was $20.8 million, primarily as a result of purchases of investments, purchases of intangible assets, purchases of property and equipment to support our office facilities, and capitalized internal-use software development costs, partially offset by proceeds from the sales, maturities, and redemptions of investments.62Table of ContentsFinancing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was $92.6 million, primarily as a result of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee equity awards of $184.6 million, partially offset by proceeds of $80.8 million from the issuance of equity securities under our equity incentive plans, and capital contributions of $13.0 million from noncontrolling interest holders. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, we began funding withholding taxes due upon the vesting of employee RSUs in certain jurisdictions by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of selling shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2022 was $178.2 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of equity securities under our equity incentive plans.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur management&#8217;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.The significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 2, &#8220;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the accounting policies and estimates associated with revenue recognition and business combinations involve a substantial degree of judgment and complexity and therefore are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionMany of our contracts with customers include multiple performance obligations. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. We consider our evaluation of SSP to be a critical accounting estimate. An observable SSP is established based on the price at which a service is sold separately. If an SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate it by maximizing the use of observable inputs, including the overall pricing strategy, market data, internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations, and other observable inputs. As our business and offerings evolve over time, modifications to our pricing and discounting methodologies, changes in the scope and nature of our offerings, and/or changes in customer segmentation may result in a lack of consistency, making it difficult to establish and/or maintain SSP. Changes in SSP could result in different and unanticipated allocations of revenue in contracts with multiple performance obligations. These factors, among others, may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a given period.Business CombinationsWhen we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, time and resources required to recreate the assets acquired. These estimates are based on information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, our assessment of the information, and historical experience. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. The amounts and estimated useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired in business combinations impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.63Table of ContentsRecent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2, &#8220;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInterest Rate RiskAs of January&#160;31, 2023, we had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, certificates of deposit, and money market funds. In addition, we had $16.8 million of restricted cash primarily due to outstanding letters of credit established in connection with lease agreements for our facilities. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments are held for working capital, capital expenditure, and general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock as well as acquisitions and strategic investments we may make from time to time. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of&#160;$26.0 million&#160;or an increase of&#160;$25.9 million, respectively, in the market value of our cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments as of&#160;January&#160;31, 2023.As of January&#160;31, 2022, we had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of&#160;$27.3 million&#160;or an increase of&#160;$23.5 million, respectively, in the market value.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar or the Euro. The majority of our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, although we also have sales in Euros and, to a lesser extent, in British pounds, Australian dollars, and Brazilian reals. Therefore our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk, but that will likely change in the future as we increase sales in these international currencies and enable sales in additional currencies. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the United States and to a lesser extent in Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific region. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at period-end exchange rates. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. In order to manage our exposure to certain foreign currency exchange risks, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, we entered into deliverable foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of one month or less to hedge a portion of certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts reduced, but did not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We did not enter into these forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 2, &#8220;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in a theoretical increase or decrease in operating loss of&#160;approximately $32 million for the&#160;fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. This sensitivity analysis assumes that all foreign currencies move in the same direction at the same time in the absence of hedging activities. In addition, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar makes our platform more expensive for international customers, which may slow down consumption. We do not believe a 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar would have had a material impact on our operating results for the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.64Table of ContentsOther Market RiskOur strategic investments consist primarily of (i) non-marketable equity securities recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the Measurement Alternative), and (ii) marketable equity securities. These strategic investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks, including volatility in the public and private markets, that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of our investments and, as a result, our financial results may fluctuate. Strategic investments are subject to periodic impairment analyses, which involves an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee&#8217;s financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee&#8217;s product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash.The following table presents our strategic investments by type (in thousands):January 31, 2023January 31, 2022Equity securities:Non-marketable equity securities under Measurement Alternative$174,248&#160;$170,860&#160;Non-marketable equity securities under equity method5,066&#160;&#8212;&#160;Marketable equity securities22,122&#160;34,646&#160;Debt securities:Non-marketable debt securities1,500&#160;2,250&#160;Total strategic investments&#8212;included in other assets$202,936&#160;$207,756&#160;See Note 5, &#8220;Fair Value Measurements,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.We plan to continue these types of strategic investments as part of our corporate development program. We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations as a result of changes in market prices, changes resulting from observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer, and impairments to our strategic investments.65Table of ContentsITEM 8.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January&#160;31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.67Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition - Capacity ArrangementsAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company delivers its platform over the internet as a service. The Company&#8217;s customers consume the platform typically under capacity arrangements, in which customers commit to a certain amount of consumption at specified prices. Management recognizes revenue as customers consume compute, storage, and data transfer resources. The Company&#8217;s total revenue for the year ended January&#160;31, 2023 was $2.1 billion, of which a significant portion is recognized under capacity arrangements.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - capacity arrangements is a critical audit matter are the significant audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to revenue recognized under capacity arrangements. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over revenue transactions recognized under capacity arrangements. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating, on a test basis, revenue recognized under capacity arrangements by obtaining and inspecting invoices, customer order forms, cash receipts from customers, usage confirmations from customers, and usage records./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaMarch&#160;29, 2023We have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2019.68Table of ContentsSNOWFLAKE INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in thousands, except per share data)January 31, 2023January 31, 2022AssetsCurrent assets:Cash and cash equivalents$939,902&#160;$1,085,729&#160;Short-term investments3,067,966&#160;2,766,364&#160;Accounts receivable, net715,821&#160;545,629&#160;Deferred commissions, current67,901&#160;51,398&#160;Prepaid expenses and other current assets193,100&#160;149,523&#160;Total current assets4,984,690&#160;4,598,643&#160;Long-term investments1,073,023&#160;1,256,207&#160;Property and equipment, net160,823&#160;105,079&#160;Operating lease right-of-use assets231,266&#160;190,356&#160;Goodwill657,370&#160;8,449&#160;Intangible assets, net186,013&#160;37,141&#160;Deferred commissions, non-current145,286&#160;124,517&#160;Other assets283,851&#160;329,306&#160;Total assets$7,722,322&#160;$6,649,698&#160;Liabilities and Stockholders&#8217; EquityCurrent liabilities:Accounts payable$23,672&#160;$13,441&#160;Accrued expenses and other current liabilities269,069&#160;200,664&#160;Operating lease liabilities, current27,301&#160;25,101&#160;Deferred revenue, current1,673,475&#160;1,157,887&#160;Total current liabilities1,993,517&#160;1,397,093&#160;Operating lease liabilities, non-current224,357&#160;181,196&#160;Deferred revenue, non-current11,463&#160;11,180&#160;Other liabilities24,370&#160;11,184&#160;Total liabilities2,253,707&#160;1,600,653&#160;Commitments and contingencies (Note 10)Stockholders&#8217; equity: Preferred stock; $0.0001 par value per share; 200,000 shares authorized, zero shares issued and outstanding as of each January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Common stock; $0.0001 par value per share; 2,500,000 Class A shares authorized, 323,305 and 312,377 shares issued and outstanding as of January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively; 185,461 Class B shares authorized, zero shares issued and outstanding as of each January&#160;31, 2023 and 202232&#160;31&#160;Additional paid-in capital8,210,750&#160;6,984,669&#160;Accumulated other comprehensive loss(38,272)(16,286)Accumulated deficit(2,716,074)(1,919,369)Total Snowflake Inc. stockholders&#8217; equity5,456,436&#160;5,049,045&#160;Noncontrolling interest12,179&#160;&#8212;&#160;Total stockholders&#8217; equity5,468,615&#160;5,049,045&#160;Total liabilities and stockholders&#8217; equity$7,722,322&#160;$6,649,698&#160;See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.69Table of ContentsSNOWFLAKE INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(in thousands, except per share data)Fiscal Year Ended January 31,202320222021Revenue$2,065,659&#160;$1,219,327&#160;$592,049&#160;Cost of revenue717,540&#160;458,433&#160;242,588&#160;Gross profit1,348,119&#160;760,894&#160;349,461&#160;Operating expenses:Sales and marketing1,106,507&#160;743,965&#160;479,317&#160;Research and development788,058&#160;466,932&#160;237,946&#160;General and administrative295,821&#160;265,033&#160;176,135&#160;Total operating expenses2,190,386&#160;1,475,930&#160;893,398&#160;Operating loss(842,267)(715,036)(543,937)Interest income73,839&#160;9,129&#160;7,507&#160;Other income (expense), net(47,565)28,947&#160;(610)Loss before income taxes(815,993)(676,960)(537,040)Provision for (benefit from) income taxes(18,467)2,988&#160;2,062&#160;Net loss(797,526)(679,948)(539,102)Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest(821)&#8212;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Net loss attributable to Snowflake Inc.$(796,705)$(679,948)$(539,102)Net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc.

Organization and Description of BusinessSnowflake Inc. (Snowflake or the Company) provides a cloud-based data platform, which enables customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data applications, and share data and data products. The Company provides its platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use. Through its platform, the Company delivers the Data Cloud, a network where Snowflake customers, partners, developers, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways. Snowflake was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 23, 2012.2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesFiscal YearThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year ends on January 31. For example, references to fiscal 2023 refer to the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023.Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snowflake&#160;Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a majority-owned subsidiary in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company records noncontrolling interest in its consolidated financial statements to recognize the minority ownership interest in its majority-owned subsidiary. Profits and losses of the majority-owned subsidiary are attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method.Segment InformationThe Company has a single operating and reportable segment. The Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance, and allocating resources. For information regarding the Company&#8217;s revenue by geographic area, see Note 3.The following table presents the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, by geographic area (in thousands):January 31, 2023January 31, 2022United States$329,275&#160;$272,895&#160;Other(1)62,814&#160;22,540&#160;Total$392,089&#160;$295,435&#160;________________(1)No individual country outside of the United States accounted for more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets as of January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022.75Table of ContentsUse of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, stand-alone selling prices (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation, internal-use software development costs, the expected period of benefit for deferred commissions, the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the carrying value of operating lease right-of-use assets, stock-based compensation, accounting for income taxes, and the fair value of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities.The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and also on assumptions that management considers reasonable. These estimates are assessed on a regular basis; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. The Company maintains its cash, cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, restricted cash and deliverable foreign currency forward contracts with high-quality financial institutions that have investment-grade ratings. For accounts receivable, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by customers up to the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company manages its accounts receivable credit risk through ongoing credit evaluation of its customers' financial conditions. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. For information regarding the Company&#8217;s significant customers, see Note 3.Foreign CurrencyThe reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar or the Euro, depending on the nature of the subsidiaries&#8217; activities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at period-end exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and have not been material for any of the periods presented.For those subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders&#8217; equity (deficit).Revenue RecognitionThe Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) for all periods presented.The Company delivers its platform over the internet as a service. Customers choose to consume the platform under either capacity arrangements, in which customers commit to a certain amount of consumption at specified prices, or under on-demand arrangements, in which the Company charges for use of the platform monthly in arrears. Under capacity arrangements, from which a majority of revenue is derived, the Company typically bills its customers annually in advance of their consumption. Revenue from on-demand arrangements typically relates to initial consumption as part of customer onboarding and, to a lesser extent, overage consumption beyond a customer&#8217;s contracted usage amount or following the expiration of a customer&#8217;s contract. Revenue from on-demand arrangements represented approximately 2%, 3%, and 4% of the Company&#8217;s revenue for the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The Company recognizes revenue as customers consume compute, storage, and data transfer resources under either of these arrangements. In limited instances, customers pay an annual deployment fee to gain access to a dedicated instance of a virtual private deployment. Deployment fees are recognized ratably over the contract term.76Table of ContentsCustomers do not have the contractual right to take possession of the Company&#8217;s platform. Pricing for the platform includes embedded support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the contract term.Customer contracts for capacity typically have a term of one to four years. To the extent customers enter into such contracts and either consume the platform in excess of their capacity commitments or continue to use the platform after expiration of the contract term, they are charged for their incremental consumption. In many cases, customer contracts permit customers to roll over any unused capacity to a subsequent order, generally on the purchase of additional capacity. Customer contracts are generally non-cancelable during the contract term, although customers can terminate for breach if the Company materially fails to perform. For those customers who do not have a capacity arrangement, the Company&#8217;s on-demand arrangements generally have a monthly stated contract term and can be terminated at any time by either the customer or the Company.For compute resources, consumption is based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For storage resources, consumption for a given customer is based on the average terabytes per month of all of such customer&#8217;s data stored in the platform. For data transfer resources, consumption is based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed. The Company&#8217;s revenue also includes professional services and other revenue, which consists primarily of consulting, on-site technical solution services, and training related to the platform. Professional services revenue is recognized over time based on input measures, including time and materials costs incurred relative to total costs, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract deliverables, when applicable. Other revenue consists primarily of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. The Company determines revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606 through the following five steps:1) Identify the contract with a customer. The Company considers the terms and conditions of the contracts and the Company&#8217;s customary business practices in identifying its contracts under ASC 606. The Company determines it has a contract with a customer when the contract has been approved by both parties, it can identify each party&#8217;s rights regarding the services to be transferred and the payment terms for the services, it has determined the customer to have the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer&#8217;s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer&#8217;s payment history or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company treats consumption of its platform for compute, storage, and data transfer resources as one single performance obligation because they are consumed by customers as a single, integrated offering. The Company does not make any one of these resources available for consumption without the others. Instead, each of compute, storage, and data transfer work together to drive consumption on the Company&#8217;s platform. The Company treats its virtual private deployments for customers, professional services, on-site technical solution services, and training each as a separate and distinct performance obligation. Some customers have negotiated an option to purchase additional capacity at a stated discount. These options generally do not provide a material right as they are priced at the Company&#8217;s SSP, as described below, as the stated discounts are not incremental to the range of discounts typically given.3) Determine the transaction price. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company&#8217;s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. Variable consideration is estimated based on expected value, primarily relying on the Company&#8217;s history. In certain situations, the Company may also use the most likely amount as the basis of its estimate. None of the Company&#8217;s contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other indirect taxes).77Table of Contents4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The determination of a relative SSP for each distinct performance obligation requires judgment. The Company determines SSP for performance obligations based on an observable standalone selling price when it is available, as well as other factors, including the overall pricing objectives, which take into consideration market conditions and customer-specific factors, including a review of internal discounting tables, the services being sold, the volume of capacity commitments, and other factors. The observable standalone selling price is established based on the price at which products and services are sold separately. If an SSP is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates it using available information including, but not limited to, market data and other observable inputs.5) Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when control of the services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company determined an output method to be the most appropriate measure of progress because it most faithfully represents when the value of the services is simultaneously received and consumed by the customer, and control is transferred. Virtual private deployment fees are recognized ratably over the term of the deployment as the deployment service represents a stand-ready performance obligation provided throughout the deployment term. Allocation of Overhead CostsOverhead costs that are not substantially dedicated for use by a specific functional group are allocated based on headcount. Such costs include costs associated with office facilities, depreciation of property and equipment, information technology (IT) and general recruiting related expenses and other expenses, such as software and subscription services.Cost of RevenueCost of revenue consists primarily of (i) third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in connection with the customers&#8217; use of the Snowflake platform and deploying and maintaining the platform on public clouds, including different regional deployments, (ii) personnel-related costs associated with the Company&#8217;s customer support team, engineering team that is responsible for maintaining the Company's service availability and security of its platform, and professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, and (iii) costs of contracted third-party partners for professional services. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of internal-use software development costs, amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets, expenses associated with software and subscription services dedicated for use by the Company&#8217;s customer support team and engineering team responsible for maintaining the Company's service, and allocated overhead.Research and Development CostsResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred, unless they qualify as internal-use software development costs. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with the Company&#8217;s research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses also include contractor or professional services fees, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing the Company&#8217;s platform, expenses associated with computer equipment, software and subscription services dedicated for use by the Company&#8217;s research and development organization, and allocated overhead.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs, excluding expenses associated with the Company&#8217;s user conferences, are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. These costs were $68.2 million, $57.5 million, and $41.0 million for the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.78Table of ContentsIncome TaxesThe Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining its provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.The Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred assets and liabilities are measured using the statutorily enacted tax rates anticipated to be in effect when those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company&#8217;s tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position will be sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. This evaluation is based on all available evidence and assumes that the tax authorities have full knowledge of all relevant information concerning the tax position. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not (greater than 50% likely) to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company makes adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences may affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted common stock granted to employees, non-employee directors, and other service providers, and stock purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP Rights) to employees, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option granted and ESPP Rights is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the grant-date fair value using an option-pricing model is affected by the estimated fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over an expected term, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate for an expected term, and expected dividends. The fair value of each RSU is based on the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant.Stock-based compensation is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with both a service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition, the stock-based compensation is recognized using an accelerated attribution method from the time it is deemed probable that the vesting condition will be met through the time the service-based vesting condition has been achieved. If an award contains a provision whereby vesting is accelerated upon a change in control, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis, as a change in control is considered to be outside of the Company&#8217;s control and is not considered probable until it occurs. Forfeitures are accounted for in the period in which they occur.79Table of ContentsDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, the Company began funding withholding taxes due upon the vesting of employee RSUs in certain jurisdictions by net share settlement, rather than its previous approach of selling shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The amount of withholding taxes related to net share settlement of employee RSUs is reflected as (i) a reduction to additional paid-in-capital, and (ii) cash outflows for financing activities when the payments are made. The shares withheld by the Company as a result of the net share settlement of RSUs are not considered issued and outstanding, and do not impact the calculation of basic net income (loss) per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. Class A and Class B common stockholders.Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Snowflake Inc. Class A and Class B Common StockholdersAs discussed in Note 12, on March 1, 2021, all shares of the Company&#8217;s then-outstanding Class B common stock were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the Company&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation.Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders is computed in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. The Company considered unvested common stock and, prior to the automatic conversion of all of its outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock into Class B common stock in connection with its initial public offering (IPO) in September 2020, all series of its redeemable convertible preferred stock to be participating securities, as the holders of such stock have the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends on a pari passu basis in the event that a dividend is declared on common stock. Under the two-class method, net loss is not allocated to the redeemable convertible preferred stock as the holders of such stock do not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company&#8217;s losses. Basic net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Snowflake Inc. common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive Snowflake Inc. common stock equivalents to the extent they are dilutive. For purposes of this calculation, redeemable convertible preferred stock, stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, ESPP Rights, early exercised stock options, and common stock warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders as their effect is anti-dilutive for all periods presented.The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Snowflake Inc. Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, converting, and transfer rights. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to each class of common stock and the resulting basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders are, therefore, the same for both Snowflake Inc. Class A and Class B common stock on both individual and combined basis. Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.Restricted CashRestricted cash primarily consists of collateralized letters of credit established in connection with lease agreements for the Company&#8217;s facilities. Restricted cash is included in current assets for leases that expire within one year and is included in non-current assets for leases that expire more than one year from the balance sheet date. Investments The Company&#8217;s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale and are recorded at estimated fair value. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term at each balance sheet date based on each instrument&#8217;s underlying contractual maturity date. Short-term investments are investments with original maturities of less than one year when purchased. Purchase premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted using the effective interest method over the life of the related security and such amortization and accretion are included in interest income in the consolidated statements of operations.80Table of ContentsFor available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its entire amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, the security&#8217;s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria is met, the Company further assesses whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost is due to credit or non-credit related factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. Credit related unrealized losses are recognized as an allowance on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding charge in the other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-credit related unrealized losses and unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.Strategic InvestmentsThe Company&#8217;s strategic investments consist of non-marketable equity and debt securities in privately-held companies and marketable equity securities in publicly-traded companies, in which the Company does not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Strategic investments are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the Measurement Alternative) or impairment. For these investments, the Company recognizes remeasurement adjustments, including upward and downward adjustments, and impairments, if any, in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Valuations of privately-held securities are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data and require the use of judgment. For example, determining whether an orderly transaction is for an identical or similar investment requires judgment based on the rights and obligations that are attached to the securities. In determining the estimated fair value of these investments, the Company uses the most recent data available to the Company. Marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.Non-marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at their estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).Strategic investments are subject to periodic impairment analysis, which would involve an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee&#8217;s financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee&#8217;s product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company recognizes an impairment through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and establishes a new carrying value for the investment.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Company&#8217;s primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, strategic investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. See Note 5 for information regarding the fair value of the Company&#8217;s investments in marketable securities and strategic investments.81Table of ContentsDerivative Financial InstrumentsDuring the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023, the Company began using derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to certain foreign currency exchange risks associated with certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of one month or less and are not designated as hedging instruments. As such, all changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations, and are intended to offset the foreign currency transaction gains or losses associated with the underlying intercompany balances. The resulting derivative assets and liabilities are measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs and presented as prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, as applicable, on the consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows at settlement of such foreign currency forward contracts are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.As of January&#160;31, 2023, all of the Company&#8217;s derivative assets and liabilities were settled, and the related realized gains (losses) were not material for the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023.Accounts Receivable, NetAccounts receivable include billed and unbilled receivables, net of allowance for credit losses. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The allowance for credit losses is estimated based on the Company&#8217;s assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable by considering various factors, including the age of each outstanding invoice, the collection history of each customer, historical write-off experience, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions over the life of the receivable. The Company assesses collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on an aggregate basis when similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when specific customers with collectibility issues are identified. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified. Internal-Use Software Development CostsThe Company capitalizes qualifying internal-use software development costs, primarily related to its cloud platform. The costs consist of personnel costs (including related benefits and stock-based compensation) that are incurred during the application development stage. Capitalization of costs begins when two criteria are met: (1) the preliminary project stage is completed, and (2) it is probable that the software will be completed and used for its intended function. Capitalization ceases when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, including the completion of all significant testing. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation operating activities are expensed as incurred.Capitalized costs are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three years, on a straight-line basis. The amortization of capitalized costs related to the Company&#8217;s platform applications is primarily included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.Property and Equipment, NetProperty and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset, ranging from generally three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of estimated useful life or the remaining lease term. Expenses that improve an asset or extend its remaining useful life are capitalized. Costs of maintenance or repairs that do not extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expenses as incurred.82Table of ContentsDeferred CommissionsThe Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if such costs are recoverable. Such costs consist primarily of (i) sales commissions tied to new customer or customer expansion contracts earned by the Company&#8217;s sales force and the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and (ii) certain referral fees earned by third parties. These costs are capitalized and then amortized over a period of benefit that is determined to be five years. The Company determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration the length of terms in its customer contracts, life of the technology, and other factors. Amounts expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are recorded as deferred commissions, current, and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred commissions, non-current, on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of modifications to the Company&#8217;s sales compensation plan during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, a portion of the sales commissions paid to the sales force is earned based on the rate of the customers&#8217; consumption of the Company&#8217;s platform, in addition to a portion of the commissions earned upon the origination of the new customer or customer expansion contract. Sales commissions tied to customers&#8217; consumption are not considered incremental costs and are expensed in the same period as they are earned. Deferred commissions are periodically analyzed for impairment. There were no impairment losses relating to the deferred commissions for all periods presented.LeasesThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception by evaluating various factors, including if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration and other facts and circumstances. Lease classification is determined at the lease commencement date. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not have any material finance leases for all periods presented.Right-of-use assets represent the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company&#8217;s obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments consist primarily of the fixed payments under the arrangement, less any lease incentives. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and include certain non-lease components, such as maintenance and other services provided by the lessor to the extent the charges are variable. The Company uses an estimate of its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. In determining the appropriate IBR, the Company considers various factors, including, but not limited to, its credit rating, the lease term, and the currency in which the arrangement is denominated. The Company&#8217;s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.The Company does not separate non-lease components from lease components for its facility asset portfolio. In addition, the Company does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.In addition, the Company subleases certain of its unoccupied facilities to third parties. Any impairment to the associated right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements, or other assets as a result of a sublease is recognized in the period the sublease is executed and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term. Sublease income is recorded as a reduction to the Company&#8217;s operating lease costs.83Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsThe Company applies a screen test to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination. When the Company acquires a business, the purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, time and resources required to recreate the assets acquired. These estimates are based on information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, the Company&#8217;s assessment of the information, and historical experience. The Company&#8217;s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill for these business combinations. Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets The Company&#8217;s long-lived assets with finite lives consist primarily of property and equipment, capitalized development software costs, operating lease right-of-use assets and acquired intangible assets. Long-lived assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds these estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. The Company did not recognize any material impairments of long-lived assets for all periods presented.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to goodwill to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill. The Company did not recognize any impairment of goodwill for all periods presented.Deferred RevenueThe Company records deferred revenue when the Company receives customer payments in advance of satisfying the performance obligations on the Company&#8217;s contracts. Capacity arrangements are generally billed and paid in advance of satisfaction of performance obligations, and the Company&#8217;s on-demand arrangements are billed in arrears generally on a monthly basis. Deferred revenue also includes amounts that have been invoiced but not yet collected, classified as accounts receivable, when the Company has an enforceable right to invoice for capacity arrangements. Deferred revenue relating to the Company&#8217;s capacity arrangements that have a contractual expiration date of less than 12 months are classified as current. For capacity arrangements that have a contractual expiration date of greater than 12 months, the Company apportions deferred revenue between current and non-current based upon an assumed ratable consumption of these capacity arrangements over the entire term of the arrangement, even though it does not recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract as customers have flexibility in their consumption and revenue is generally recognized on consumption. In addition, in many cases, the Company&#8217;s customer contracts also permit customers to roll over any unused capacity to a subsequent order, generally on the purchase of additional capacity. As such, the current or non-current classification of deferred revenue may not reflect the actual timing of revenue recognition.84Table of ContentsRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, with further clarifications made more recently. For trade receivables, loans, and other financial instruments, the Company is required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities are required to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The Company early adopted this guidance effective February 1, 2021 on a modified retrospective basis, and the adoption did not result in any cumulative effect adjustment in its consolidated financial statements.In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other&#8212;Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by this new guidance. The Company adopted this guidance effective February 1, 2021 on a prospective basis, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating some exceptions to the general approach in ASC 740, Income Taxes in order to reduce the cost and complexity of its application. The Company early adopted this guidance effective February 1, 2021, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company early adopted this guidance upon issuance to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of adoption, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.3.

(2)Includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Accounts Receivable, NetAs of January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, allowance for credit losses of $2.2 million and $1.3 million, was included in the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable, net balance, respectively.Significant CustomersFor purposes of assessing the concentration of credit risk and significant customers, a group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other are regarded as a single customer. As of January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, there were no customers that represented 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable, net balance. Additionally, there were no customers that represented 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s revenue for each of the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.Deferred RevenueThe Company recognized $974.3 million, $535.8 million, and $257.9 million of revenue for the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, from the deferred revenue balances as of January&#160;31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.Remaining Performance ObligationsRemaining performance obligations (RPO) represent the amount of contracted future revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. The Company&#8217;s RPO excludes performance obligations from on-demand arrangements as there are no minimum purchase commitments associated with these arrangements, and certain time and materials contracts that are billed in arrears. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange rates. As of January&#160;31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s RPO was $3.7 billion, of which the Company expects approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the twelve months ending January 31, 2024 based on historical customer consumption patterns. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition are generally dependent upon customers&#8217; future consumption, which is inherently variable at customers&#8217; discretion and can extend beyond the original contract term in cases where customers are permitted to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally on the purchase of additional capacity at renewal.4.

Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows:Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for the Company&#8217;s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January&#160;31, 2023 (in thousands):Level 1Level 2TotalCash equivalents:Money market funds$379,094&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$379,094&#160;Commercial paper&#8212;&#160;9,304&#160;9,304&#160;Corporate notes and bonds&#8212;&#160;6,903&#160;6,903&#160;Certificates of deposit&#8212;&#160;3,044&#160;3,044&#160;Short-term investments:Corporate notes and bonds&#8212;&#160;1,301,296&#160;1,301,296&#160;Commercial paper&#8212;&#160;881,348&#160;881,348&#160;Certificates of deposit&#8212;&#160;445,194&#160;445,194&#160;U.S. government and agency securities&#8212;&#160;440,128&#160;440,128&#160;Long-term investments:Corporate notes and bonds&#8212;&#160;801,784&#160;801,784&#160;U.S. government and agency securities&#8212;&#160;263,708&#160;263,708&#160;Certificates of deposit&#8212;&#160;7,531&#160;7,531&#160;Total$379,094&#160;$4,160,240&#160;$4,539,334&#160;89Table of ContentsThe following table presents the fair value hierarchy for the Company&#8217;s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January&#160;31, 2022 (in thousands):Level 1Level 2TotalCash equivalents:Money market funds$722,492&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$722,492&#160;Commercial paper&#8212;&#160;77,794&#160;77,794&#160;U.S. government securities&#8212;&#160;36,995&#160;36,995&#160;Corporate notes and bonds&#8212;&#160;7,949&#160;7,949&#160;Short-term investments:Corporate notes and bonds&#8212;&#160;1,662,436&#160;1,662,436&#160;Commercial paper&#8212;&#160;883,636&#160;883,636&#160;U.S. government and agency securities&#8212;&#160;116,712&#160;116,712&#160;Certificates of deposit&#8212;&#160;103,580&#160;103,580&#160;Long-term investments:Corporate notes and bonds&#8212;&#160;935,603&#160;935,603&#160;U.S. government and agency securities&#8212;&#160;320,207&#160;320,207&#160;Certificates of deposit&#8212;&#160;397&#160;397&#160;Total$722,492&#160;$4,145,309&#160;$4,867,801&#160;The Company determines the fair value of its security holdings based on pricing from the Company&#8217;s service providers and market prices from industry-standard independent data providers. Such market prices may be quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs) or pricing determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs), such as yield curve, volatility factors, credit spreads, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt, broker and dealer quotes, as well as other relevant economic measures.Strategic InvestmentsThe tables above do not include the Company&#8217;s strategic investments, which consist primarily of non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the Measurement Alternative and marketable equity securities.The Company&#8217;s non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the Measurement Alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis and classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market are used in estimating their fair value. The estimation of fair value for these assets requires the use of an observable transaction price or other unobservable inputs, including the volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities the Company holds. The Company&#8217;s marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using the quoted market price.The following table presents the Company&#8217;s strategic investments by type (in thousands):January 31, 2023January 31, 2022Equity securities:Non-marketable equity securities under Measurement Alternative$174,248&#160;$170,860&#160;Non-marketable equity securities under equity method5,066&#160;&#8212;&#160;Marketable equity securities22,122&#160;34,646&#160;Debt securities:Non-marketable debt securities1,500&#160;2,250&#160;Total strategic investments&#8212;included in other assets$202,936&#160;$207,756&#160;90Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s strategic investments in equity securities held as of January&#160;31, 2023 (in thousands):Fiscal Year Ended January 31,20232022Non-marketable equity securities under Measurement Alternative:Upward adjustments$4,125&#160;$32,975&#160;Impairments(38,036)&#8212;&#160;Marketable equity securities:Net unrealized losses(12,524)(5,354)Total&#8212;included in other income (expense), net$(46,435)$27,621&#160;During the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2021, the Company did not have any strategic investments in marketable equity securities and did not record any upward or downward adjustments, or impairments, on non-marketable equity securities under Measurement Alternative.No realized gains or losses were recognized on the Company&#8217;s strategic investments in equity securities during any of periods presented. The cumulative upward adjustments and the cumulative impairments to the carrying value of the non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the Measurement Alternative that the Company held as of January&#160;31, 2023 were $37.1 million and $38.0 million, respectively.6.

Business CombinationsFiscal 2023Streamlit, Inc.On March 31, 2022, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of Streamlit, Inc. (Streamlit), a privately-held company which provides an open-source framework for creating and deploying data applications. The Company acquired Streamlit primarily for its talent and developer community. The Company has accounted for this transaction as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the purchase consideration was $650.8 million, which was comprised of the following (in thousands):Estimated Fair ValueCash$211,839&#160;Common stock(1)438,916&#160;Total$650,755&#160;________________(1)Approximately 1.9&#160;million shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock were included in the purchase consideration and the fair values of these shares were determined based on the closing market price of $229.13 per share on the acquisition date.In addition, in connection with this business combination, the Company issued to Streamlit&#8217;s three founders a total of 0.4&#160;million shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock in exchange for a portion of their Streamlit stock. These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over three years, subject to each founder&#8217;s continued employment with the Company or its affiliates. The $93.7&#160;million fair value of these shares are accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of three years. See Note 12 for further discussion.The purchase consideration was preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment which did not have a material impact on goodwill. The updated preliminary allocation of purchase consideration, inclusive of measurement period adjustments, was as follows:Estimated Fair Value(in thousands)Estimated Useful Life(in years)Cash and cash equivalents$33,914&#160;Goodwill494,411&#160;Developer community intangible asset150,000&#160;5Other net tangible liabilities(659)Deferred tax liabilities, net(1)(26,911)Total$650,755&#160;________________(1)Deferred tax liabilities, net primarily relates to the intangible asset acquired and the amount presented is net of deferred tax assets.The fair value of the developer community intangible asset was estimated using the replacement cost method which utilizes assumptions for the cost to replace it, such as time and resources required, as well as a theoretical profit margin and opportunity cost. The excess of purchase consideration over the preliminary fair value of identifiable net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The Company believes the goodwill balance associated with this business combination represents the synergies expected from expanded market opportunities when integrating the acquired developed technologies with the Company&#8217;s offerings.Acquisition-related costs of $1.9&#160;million associated with this business combination were recorded as a general and administrative expense during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. 92Table of ContentsFrom the date of acquisition through January&#160;31, 2023, revenue attributable to Streamlit was not material. It was impracticable to determine the effect on the Company's net loss attributable to Streamlit as its operations have been integrated into the Company's ongoing operations since the date of acquisition.Applica Sp. z.o.o.On September&#160;23, 2022, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of Applica Sp. z.o.o. (Applica), a privately-held company which provides an artificial intelligence platform for document understanding, for $174.7 million in cash. The Company acquired Applica primarily for its talent and developed technology. The Company has accounted for this transaction as a business combination.The purchase consideration was preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment which did not have a material impact on goodwill.

The excess of purchase consideration over the preliminary fair value of identifiable net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is generally not deductible for income tax purposes. The Company believes the goodwill balance associated with this business combination represents the synergies expected from expanded market opportunities when integrating the acquired developed technologies with the Company&#8217;s offerings.Acquisition-related costs of $3.4 million associated with this business combination were recorded as a general and administrative expense during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.The results of operations of Applica from the date of acquisition, which were not material, have been included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.Other Business CombinationDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of a privately-held company for $10.4&#160;million in cash. The Company has accounted for this transaction as a business combination. In allocating the aggregate purchase consideration based on the estimated fair values, the Company recorded $2.0&#160;million as a developed technology intangible asset (to be amortized over an estimated useful life of five years), $0.3&#160;million of net tangible assets acquired, and $8.1&#160;million as goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company believes the goodwill balance associated with this business combination is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expected synergies arising from the acquisition.93Table of ContentsAcquisition-related costs associated with this business combination were not material for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, and were recorded as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.From the date of acquisition through January&#160;31, 2023, revenue attributable to this business combination was not material.

The Company has accounted for this transaction as a business combination. In allocating the aggregate purchase consideration based on the estimated fair values, the Company recorded $5.7&#160;million as a developed technology intangible asset (to be amortized over an estimated useful life of five years) and $1.4&#160;million as goodwill, which is deductible for income tax purposes.The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company believes the goodwill balance associated with this business combination represents the synergies expected from expanded market opportunities when integrating the acquired developed technologies with the Company&#8217;s offerings. Acquisition-related costs associated with this business combination were not material for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, and were recorded as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The results of operations of the business combination have been included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.

The Company is required to pay the difference if it fails to meet the minimum purchase commitment by December 2025, and such payment can be applied to qualifying expenditures for cloud infrastructure services for up to twelve months after December 2025.In January 2023, the Company amended one of its third-party cloud infrastructure agreements effective February 1, 2023 (the January 2023 Amendment). Under the amended agreement, the Company has committed to spend an aggregate of at least $2.5 billion from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028 on cloud infrastructure services ($350.0 million in fiscal 2024, $450.0 million in fiscal 2025, $500.0 million in fiscal 2026, $550.0 million in fiscal 2027, and $650.0 million in fiscal 2028), which are reflected in the table above. The Company is required to pay the difference if it fails to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any fiscal year, and such payment can be applied to qualifying expenditures for cloud infrastructure services during the term of the amended agreement. The remaining non-cancelable purchase commitments under the agreement prior to the January 2023 Amendment, the aggregate amount of which was $732.0 million as of January&#160;31, 2023, is not reflected in the table above as the Company is no longer required to fulfill such commitments. 401(k) Plan&#8212;The Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering all eligible U.S. employees. Contributions to the 401(k) plan are discretionary. The Company did not make any matching contributions to the 401(k) plan for each of the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.Legal Matters&#8212;The Company is involved from time to time in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company believes that none of its current legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Letters of Credit&#8212;As of January&#160;31, 2023, the Company had a total of $16.8 million in cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding, substantially in favor of certain landlords for the Company&#8217;s leased facilities. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through fiscal 2033.Indemnification&#8212;The Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including business partners, investors, contractors, customers, and the Company&#8217;s officers, non-employee directors, and certain employees. The Company has agreed to indemnify and defend the indemnified party for claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party from actual or threatened third-party claims due to the Company&#8217;s activities or non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company&#8217;s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. For each of the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisions were not material.98Table of Contents11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred StockUpon completion of its IPO in September 2020, as further discussed in Note 12, all shares of the Company&#8217;s redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding, totaling 182.3 million, were automatically converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock on one-to-one basis and their carrying value of $1.4 billion was reclassified into stockholders&#8217; equity. As of January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, there were no shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.12. EquityInitial Public Offering and Private Placements&#8212;In September 2020, the Company completed its IPO, in which the Company issued and sold 32.2 million shares of its Class A common stock at $120.00 per share, including 4.2 million shares issued upon the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; option to purchase additional shares. The Company received net proceeds of $3.7 billion after deducting underwriting discounts. In connection with the IPO:&#8226;all 182.3 million shares of the Company&#8217;s outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock on a one-to-one basis; and&#8226;Salesforce Ventures LLC and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. each purchased 2.1 million shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock at $120.00 per share in concurrent private placements that closed immediately subsequent to the closing of the IPO. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $500.0 million in these concurrent private placements and did not pay underwriting discounts with respect to the shares of Class A common stock that were sold in these private placements.Prior to the IPO, deferred offering costs, which consist of direct incremental legal, accounting, and consulting fees relating to the IPO, were capitalized in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. These deferred offering costs, net of reimbursement received from the underwriters upon completion of the IPO, were not material.Preferred Stock&#8212;In connection with the IPO, the Company&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective, which authorized the issuance of 200.0 million shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share and with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of directors.Common Stock and Elimination of Dual-Class Structure&#8212;The Company has two classes of common stock authorized: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. In connection with the IPO, the Company&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized the issuance of 2.5 billion shares of Class A common stock and 355.0 million shares of Class B common stock. On March 1, 2021, all 169.5 million shares of the Company's then-outstanding Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, pursuant to the terms of the Company&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion. The shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock were identical prior to the conversion, except with respect to voting, converting, and transfer rights. Prior to the conversion, each share of Class B common stock was entitled to cast ten votes per share on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company&#8217;s stockholders. As a result of the conversion, all former holders of shares of Class B common stock are now holders of shares of Class A common stock, which is entitled to only one vote per share on all matters subject to a stockholder vote. Class A and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive any dividends as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors.99Table of ContentsPrior to the conversion, shares of Class B common stock were convertible to Class A common stock at any time at the option of the stockholder, and shares of Class B common stock would automatically convert to Class A common stock upon the following: (i) sale or transfer of such share of Class B common stock; (ii) the death of the Class B common stockholder (or nine months after the date of death if the stockholder is one of the Company&#8217;s founders); and (iii) on the final conversion date, defined as the earlier to occur following an IPO of (a) the first trading day on or after the date on which the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represented less than 10% of the then outstanding Class A and Class B common stock; (b) September 15, 2027, which is the seventh anniversary of the effectiveness of the registration statement filed in connection with the IPO; or (c) the date specified by a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a single class.In addition, on March 3, 2021, the Company filed a certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware effecting the retirement of the shares of Class B common stock that were issued but no longer outstanding following the conversion. Upon the effectiveness of the certificate, the Company&#8217;s total number of authorized shares of capital stock was reduced by the retirement of 169.5 million shares of Class B common stock.The Company had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows (in thousands):January 31, 2023January 31, 20222012 Equity Incentive Plan:Options outstanding35,212&#160;42,043&#160;Restricted stock units outstanding2,521&#160;4,530&#160;2020 Equity Incentive Plan:Options outstanding642&#160;&#8212;&#160;Restricted stock units outstanding13,039&#160;5,082&#160;Shares available for future grants52,989&#160;45,446&#160;2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan:Shares available for future grants11,046&#160;8,209&#160;Total shares of common stock reserved for future issuance115,449&#160;105,310&#160;In February 2020, certain third parties unaffiliated with the Company commenced an offer to purchase existing outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s Class B common stock from certain equity holders at a price of $38.77 per share. The Company was not a party to this transaction. The transaction was completed in March 2020, and an aggregate of 8.6 million shares of the Company&#8217;s Class B common stock were transferred to these third parties.Equity Incentive Plans&#8212;In 2012, the Company&#8217;s board of directors approved the adoption of the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (2012 Plan). The 2012 Plan provides for the grant of stock-based awards to employees, non-employee directors, and other service providers of the Company. The 2012 Plan was terminated in September 2020 in connection with the IPO but continues to govern the terms of outstanding awards that were granted prior to the termination of the 2012 Plan. No further stock-based awards will be granted under the 2012 Plan. With the establishment of the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (2020 Plan) as further discussed below, upon the expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or reacquisition of any shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards granted under the 2012 Plan, an equal number of shares of Class A common stock will become available for grant under the 2020 Plan. On March 1, 2021, all shares of the Company&#8217;s then-outstanding Class B common stock were automatically converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock. As a result of this conversion, options and RSUs that were previously denominated in shares of Class B common stock and issued under the 2012 Plan remained unchanged, except that they represent the right to receive shares of Class A common stock.100Table of ContentsIn September 2020, the Company&#8217;s board of directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan, which became effective in connection with the IPO. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, RSU awards, performance awards and other forms of equity compensation (collectively, equity awards). A total of 34.1 million shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan in addition to (i) any annual automatic evergreen increases in the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan and (ii) upon the expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or reacquisition of any shares of Class B common stock underlying outstanding stock awards granted under the 2012 Plan, an equal number of shares of Class A common stock, such number of shares not to exceed&#160;78.8&#160;million. On February 1, 2022, the shares available for future grants under the 2020 Plan were automatically increased by 15.6 million shares pursuant to the provision described in the preceding sentence.In September 2020, the Company&#8217;s board of directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2020 ESPP), which became effective in connection with the IPO. The 2020 ESPP authorizes the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees. A total of 5.7&#160;million shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the 2020 ESPP, in addition to any annual automatic evergreen increases in the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2020 ESPP. On February 1, 2022, the shares available for future grants under the 2020 ESPP were automatically increased by 3.1 million shares pursuant to the provision described in the preceding sentence. The price at which Class A common stock is purchased under the 2020 ESPP is equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. Offering periods are generally six months long and begin on March 15 and September 15 of each year, except for the first two offering periods. The initial offering period began on September 15, 2020 and ended on February 26, 2021. The second offering period began on March 1, 2021 and ended on September 14, 2021.Stock Options&#8212;Stock options granted under the 2012 Plan and the 2020 Plan (collectively, the Plans) generally vest based on continued service over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Certain stock options granted under the 2012 Plan are exercisable at any time following the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant.101Table of ContentsA summary of stock option activity and activity regarding shares available for grant under the Plans during the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is as follows:SharesAvailable for Grant(in thousands)Number&#160;of Options Outstanding(in thousands)Weighted-AverageExercise&#160;PriceWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life(in&#160;years)AggregateIntrinsicValue(in thousands)Balance&#8212;January&#160;31, 2020412&#160;80,903&#160;$6.21&#160;8.6$1,546,313&#160;Shares authorized54,970&#8212;Shares ceased to be available for issuance under the 2012 Plan(15,696)&#8212;Options granted(877)877$34.83&#160;Options exercised&#8212;(13,799)$3.90&#160;Options canceled3,406(3,406)$7.04&#160;Repurchase of unvested common stock40&#8212;RSUs granted(9,553)&#8212;RSUs forfeited168&#8212;Balance&#8212;January&#160;31, 202132,87064,575$7.04&#160;7.7$17,138,896&#160;Shares authorized14,397&#8212;Options exercised&#8212;(20,903)$6.08&#160;Options canceled1,629(1,629)$6.80&#160;RSUs granted(4,026)&#8212;RSUs forfeited576&#8212;Balance&#8212;January&#160;31, 202245,44642,043$7.53&#160;6.9$11,283,299&#160;Shares authorized15,619&#8212;Options granted(642)642$207.56&#160;Options exercised&#8212;(6,118)$6.50&#160;Options canceled713(713)$8.02&#160;RSUs granted(10,788)&#8212;Shares withheld related to net share settlement of RSUs1,149&#8212;RSUs forfeited1,492&#8212;Balance&#8212;January&#160;31, 202352,98935,854$11.27&#160;5.9$5,237,549&#160;Vested and exercisable as of January&#160;31, 202330,261$8.20&#160;5.8$4,492,574&#160;No options were granted during the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2022. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023 and 2021 was $101.66 and $22.67, respectively. The intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $1.0 billion, $5.7 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. The aggregate grant-date fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $79.1 million, $81.0 million, and $90.9 million, respectively.Early Exercised Stock Options&#8212;Common stock purchased pursuant to an early exercise of stock options is not deemed to be outstanding for accounting purposes until those shares vest. The consideration received for an exercise of an option is considered to be a deposit of the exercise price and the related dollar amount is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The shares issued upon the early exercise of these unvested stock option awards, which are reflected as exercises in the stock option activity table above, are considered to be legally issued and outstanding on the date of exercise. Upon termination of service, the Company may repurchase unvested shares acquired through the early exercise of stock options at a price equal to the price per share paid upon the exercise of such options. Shares subject to repurchase as a result of early exercised options were not material as of each January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022.102Table of ContentsRSUs&#8212;In March 2020, the Company began granting more RSUs than options to its employees and non-employee directors. RSUs granted prior to the IPO had both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions. The service-based vesting condition for these awards is typically satisfied over four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied on the earlier of (i) the effective date of a registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act for the sale of the Company&#8217;s common stock or (ii) immediately prior to the closing of a change in control of the Company. Both events were not deemed probable until consummated, and therefore, stock-based compensation related to these RSUs remained unrecognized prior to the effectiveness of the IPO. Upon the effectiveness of the IPO in September 2020, the performance-based vesting condition was satisfied, and therefore, the Company recognized cumulative stock-based compensation of $55.5&#160;million using the accelerated attribution method for the portion of the RSU awards for which the service-based vesting condition has been fully or partially satisfied. RSUs granted after the IPO do not contain the performance-based vesting condition described above, and the related stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.A summary of RSU activity during the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is as follows:Number of Shares(in thousands)Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Valueper ShareUnvested Balance&#8212;January&#160;31, 2020&#8212;&#160;$&#8212;&#160;Granted9,553&#160;$123.71&#160;Vested(37)$50.71&#160;Forfeited(168)$64.13&#160;Unvested Balance&#8212;January&#160;31, 20219,348&#160;$125.06&#160;Granted4,026&#160;$250.46&#160;Vested(3,186)$109.44&#160;Forfeited(576)$169.74&#160;Unvested Balance&#8212;January&#160;31, 20229,612&#160;$180.08&#160;Granted10,788&#160;$180.65&#160;Vested(3,348)$165.30&#160;Forfeited(1,492)$206.02&#160;Unvested Balance&#8212;January&#160;31, 202315,560&#160;$181.17&#160;Restricted Common Stock&#8212;Restricted common stock is not deemed to be outstanding for accounting purposes until it vests. From time to time, the Company has granted restricted common stock outside of the Plans.

These shares are subject to vesting agreements pursuant to which the shares will vest over three years, subject to each founder&#8217;s continued employment with the Company or its affiliates. The $93.7&#160;million fair value of these shares are accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation over the requisite service period of three years. As of January&#160;31, 2023, all 0.4&#160;million shares remained unvested.In December 2017, the Company issued 1.3&#160;million shares of restricted common stock outside of the Plans to an employee at $1.59 per share, payable by a promissory note. The promissory note accrued interest at the lower of 2.11% per annum or the maximum interest rate on commercial loans permissible by law and was partially secured by the underlying restricted stock. The promissory note was considered nonrecourse from an accounting standpoint, and therefore the note was not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders&#8217; equity (deficit). Rather, the note and the share purchases were accounted for as stock option grants, with the related stock-based compensation measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognized over the vesting period of five years. The associated shares are legally outstanding and included in the balance of Class B common stock outstanding in the consolidated financial statements during the periods in which Class B common stock was outstanding and in the balance of Class A common stock outstanding thereafter. None of these shares of restricted common stock were considered vested before the underlying promissory note was repaid. In May and June 2020, the outstanding principal amount and all accrued interest under this promissory note of $2.1 million was repaid, and the 1.3&#160;million shares of restricted common stock were fully vested as of January&#160;31, 2023.Stock-Based Compensation&#8212;The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted to employees and a non-employee director during the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023 and 2021:Fiscal Year Ended January 31,20232021Expected term (in years)6.06.0Expected volatility50.0&#160;%37.2&#160;%Risk-free interest rate1.8&#160;%1.0&#160;%Expected dividend yield&#8212;&#160;%&#8212;&#160;%No stock options were granted during the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2022.Expected term&#8212;For stock options considered to be &#8220;plain vanilla&#8221; options, the Company estimates the expected term based on the simplified method, which is essentially the weighted average of the vesting period and contractual term, as the Company&#8217;s historical option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.&#160;Expected volatility&#8212;Prior to fiscal 2023, the Company performed an analysis of using the average volatility of a peer group of representative public companies with sufficient trading history over the expected term to develop an expected volatility assumption. During the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023, the Company began using the average volatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of a peer group of representative public companies to develop an expected volatility assumption.Risk-free interest rate&#8212;Risk-free rate is estimated based upon quoted market yields for the United States Treasury debt securities for a term consistent with the expected life of the awards in effect at the time of grant.Expected dividend yield&#8212;Because the Company has never paid and has no intention to pay cash dividends on common stock, the expected dividend yield is zero.104Table of ContentsFair value of underlying common stock&#8212;Prior to the completion of the IPO, the board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock at each meeting in which awards were approved. The factors considered included, but were not limited to: (i)&#160;the results of contemporaneous independent third-party valuations of the Company&#8217;s common stock; (ii)&#160;the prices, rights, preferences, and privileges of the Company&#8217;s redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of its common stock; (iii)&#160;the lack of marketability of the Company&#8217;s common stock; (iv)&#160;actual operating and financial results; (v)&#160;current business conditions and projections; (vi)&#160;the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of the Company, given prevailing market conditions; and (vii)&#160;precedent transactions involving the Company&#8217;s shares. Since the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of its common stock, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of employee stock purchase rights granted under the 2020 ESPP during the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:Fiscal Year Ended January 31,202320222021Expected term (in years)0.50.50.5Expected volatility58.9% - 74.8%37.3% - 49.5%60.1&#160;%Risk-free interest rate0.9% - 3.8%0.1&#160;%0.1&#160;%Expected dividend yield&#8212;&#160;%&#8212;&#160;%&#8212;&#160;%Stock-based compensation included in the consolidated statements of operations was as follows (in thousands):Fiscal Year Ended January 31,202320222021Cost of revenue$106,302&#160;$87,336&#160;$33,642&#160;Sales and marketing246,811&#160;185,970&#160;97,879&#160;Research and development407,524&#160;232,867&#160;99,223&#160;General and administrative100,896&#160;98,922&#160;70,697&#160;Stock-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized861,533&#160;605,095&#160;301,441&#160;Capitalized stock-based compensation29,417&#160;24,174&#160;2,072&#160;Total stock-based compensation$890,950&#160;$629,269&#160;$303,513&#160;As of January&#160;31, 2023, total compensation cost related to unvested equity awards not yet recognized was $2.4 billion, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.13.

As of January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, the Company believes it is more likely than not that its U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable and continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets.106Table of ContentsSignificant components of the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are shown below (in thousands):January 31, 2023January 31, 2022Deferred tax assets:Net operating losses carryforwards$1,567,135&#160;$1,522,969&#160;Tax credit carryforwards274,690&#160;215,934&#160;Capitalized research and development147,328&#160;&#8212;&#160;Stock-based compensation123,408&#160;88,743&#160;Operating lease liabilities55,079&#160;48,682&#160;Net unrealized losses on strategic investments5,669&#160;&#8212;&#160;Other46,361&#160;79,141&#160;Total deferred tax assets2,219,670&#160;1,955,469&#160;Less: valuation allowance(2,100,594)(1,858,730)Net deferred tax assets119,076&#160;96,739&#160;Deferred tax liabilities:Deferred commissions(31,940)(28,368)Intangible assets(39,426)(15,692)Operating lease right-of-use assets(53,829)(48,307)Net unrealized gains on strategic investments&#8212;&#160;(6,399)Other(2,358)&#8212;&#160;Total deferred tax liabilities(127,553)(98,766)Net deferred tax liabilities$(8,477)$(2,027)The valuation allowance was $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion as of January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily relating to U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit&#160;carryforwards. The valuation allowance increased $241.9 million during the fiscal year ended January&#160;31, 2023, primarily due to increased&#160;U.S. federal and state&#160;net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, capitalized research and development, and stock-based compensation. The valuation allowance increased $1.3 billion and $434.5 million during the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily due to increased&#160;U.S. federal and state&#160;net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, deferred revenue, and stock-based compensation.As of January&#160;31, 2023, the Company had U.S. federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $5.8 billion, $5.1 billion, and $159.0 million, respectively. Of the $5.8 billion U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, $5.7 billion may be carried forward indefinitely with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income, and the remaining $0.1 billion will begin to expire in 2032. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2023. Of the $159.0 million foreign net operating loss carryforwards, $150.2 million may be carried forward indefinitely, and the remaining $8.8 million will begin to expire in 2027. As of January&#160;31, 2023, the Company also had federal and state tax credits of $254.5 million and $112.5 million, respectively. The federal tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in 2032 if not utilized. The state tax credit carryforwards do not expire. Utilization of the Company&#8217;s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for the cumulative undistributed earnings of the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries as of January&#160;31, 2023 due to the Company&#8217;s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.107Table of ContentsThe following table shows the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):Fiscal Year Ended January 31,202320222021Beginning balance$57,715&#160;$19,349&#160;$4,057&#160;Increases based on tax positions during the prior period1,816&#160;20&#160;35&#160;Increases based on tax positions during the current period15,649&#160;38,346&#160;15,257&#160;Ending balance$75,180&#160;$57,715&#160;$19,349&#160;There were no interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits for each of the fiscal years ended January&#160;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next 12 months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities, the Company does not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and in various international jurisdictions. Tax years 2012 and forward generally remain open for examination for federal and state tax purposes. Tax years 2017 and forward generally remain open for examination for foreign tax purposes. To the extent utilized in future years&#8217; tax returns, net operating loss carryforwards at January&#160;31, 2023 and 2022 will remain subject to examination until the respective tax year is closed.On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Act) into law. The Inflation Act contains certain tax measures, including a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on some large corporations and an excise tax of 1% on share repurchases. The Company is currently evaluating the various provisions of the Inflation Act and does not anticipate the impact, if any, will be material to the Company, including in connection with the Company&#8217;s stock repurchase program.14.

Related Party TransactionsIn December 2020, as a minority investor, the Company made a strategic investment of approximately $20.0 million by purchasing non-marketable equity securities issued by a privately-held company (the Strategic Investee), which&#160;is partially owned by two of the holders of more than 5% of the Company&#8217;s capital stock as of the time of investment, and two members of the Company&#8217;s board of directors are also members of the board directors of this privately-held company. In addition, the Company has entered into immaterial customer agreements and vendor contracts with the Strategic Investee since fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2018, respectively. In November 2021, the Strategic Investee raised additional funding in an orderly transaction, at which time it was no longer considered a related party of the Company. 16. Subsequent EventsBusiness Combinations On February&#160;10, 2023, the Company acquired (i) all outstanding stock of Mountain US Corporation (f/k/a Mobilize.net Corporation), a privately-held company which provides a premier suite of tools for efficiently migrating databases to the Data Cloud, for approximately $67&#160;million in cash, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, and (ii) all outstanding stock of LeapYear Technologies, Inc., a privately-held company which provides a differential privacy platform, for approximately $59&#160;million in cash, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. The Company is currently evaluating the purchase price allocation for these transactions.Stock Repurchase ProgramIn February 2023, the Company&#8217;s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion of its outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be effected, from time to time, either on the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program is funded using the Company&#8217;s working capital and will expire in March 2025.The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company&#8217;s discretion.109Table of ContentsITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURENone.ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of January&#160;31, 2023. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of January&#160;31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission&#8217;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of January&#160;31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January&#160;31, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January&#160;31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended January&#160;31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 110Table of ContentsITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATIONNone.ITEM 9C.
