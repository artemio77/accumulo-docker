We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this report. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.

The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those described in the section titled &#x201c;Risk Factors&#x201d; and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this report.

These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information.

Accordingly, they do not include all disclosures normally required in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 3, 2023 (the &#34;2022 Form 10-K&#34;).These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the Company&#x2019;s financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future interim or annual period. Principles of ConsolidationThe unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the allowance for credit losses, the lives of tangible and intangible assets, the valuation of acquired intangible assets and the recoverability or impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, internal-use software development costs, valuation of stock warrants issued, stock-based compensation, and accounting for income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and also on assumptions that management considers reasonable. The Company assesses these estimates on a regular basis; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.Custodial AccountsThe Company has established a relationship with its merchant processors to act as collection and paying agents, whereby a merchant processor receives funds from customers and forwards such funds to the respective Paymentus client, based on the instructions received from the Company. These merchant processors act as custodians of the cash received, and the Company has no legal ownership rights to the funds held in such custodial accounts and does not control the use of these funds. As the Company does not take ownership of the funds, these custodial accounts are not included in the Company&#x2019;s consolidated balance sheets. The balance of cash in the custodial accounts held by these merchant processors was $94.1 million and $353.9 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.&#160;9 &#160;Restricted Funds Held for Financial Institutions and Financial Institution Funds In-TransitRestricted funds held for financial institutions and the corresponding liability of financial institution funds in-transit represent the timing differences arising between the amounts the Company's sponsor bank receives from the sending financial institutions and the amounts disbursed to the recipient financial institutions. The restricted funds held for financial institutions' account is a transaction account maintained at the Company&#x2019;s sponsor bank for clearing payments from financial institutions (as defined by the U.S. Treasury&#x2019;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) to other financial institutions. Restricted funds held for financial institutions represent restricted cash that, based upon the Company's intent, are restricted solely for satisfying the corresponding obligations to send funds to the various financial institutions. During the fourth quarter 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with a financial institution whereby the financial institution would take over the legal ownership of these funds and operate as the custodial service provider. Once these funds were moved to custodial accounts, the Company no longer had legal ownership or control over these funds, and as such the Company no longer has Restricted Funds held for Financial Institutions and Financial Institution Funds In-Transit on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. For accounts receivable, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for either of the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 one customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.Segment InformationOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (&#x201c;CODM&#x201d;) in deciding how to make operating decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The Company has three operating segments based on geography. The United States segment represents the vast majority of the Company&#x2019;s consolidated net sales and gross profit. The additional two operating segments, Canada and India, do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate reporting, either individually or in the aggregate. None of the operating segments qualified for aggregation. The Company&#x2019;s CODM is its chief executive officer. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company&#x2019;s operating segments based on revenue and gross profit. The Company does not analyze discrete segment balance sheet information related to long-term assets. All other financial information is presented on a consolidated basis. For information regarding the Company&#x2019;s long-lived assets and revenue by geographic area, see Note 5 and Note 3, respectively.Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe Company&#x2019;s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, &#x201c;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#x201d; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 included in the 2022 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to these policies during the three months ended March 31, 2023.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsThe Company is provided the option to adopt new or revised accounting guidance as an &#x201c;emerging growth company&#x201d; under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 either (1) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to public business entities, or (2) within the same time periods as non-public business entities, including early adoption when permissible. With the exception of standards the Company elected to early adopt, when permissible, the Company has elected to adopt new or revised accounting guidance within the same time period as non-public business entities, as indicated below.ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, &#34;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers&#34; (&#34;ASU 2021-08&#34;). ASU 2021-08 will require companies to apply the definition of a performance obligation under ASU 2014-09, Revenue from contracts with customers (&#x201c;Topic 606&#x201d;) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities relating to contracts with customers that are acquired in a business combination. Under current U.S. GAAP, an acquirer generally recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers, at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 will result in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under ASU Topic 606. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2023, and its adoption did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. &#160; 10 &#160; 3. Revenue, Performance Obligations and Contract BalancesDisaggregation of RevenueThe following table presents a disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers (in thousands): &#160; &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2023 &#160; &#160; 2022 &#160; Payment transaction processing revenue &#160; $ 146,388 &#160; &#160; $ 114,962 &#160; Other &#160; &#160; 1,940 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,742 &#160; Total revenue &#160; $ 148,328 &#160; &#160; $ 116,704 &#160; Revenue by geographic area, based on the location of the Company&#x2019;s users, was as follows (in thousands): &#160; &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2023 &#160; &#160; 2022 &#160; United States &#160; $ 145,557 &#160; &#160; $ 113,960 &#160; Other &#160; &#160; 2,771 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,744 &#160; Total &#160; $ 148,328 &#160; &#160; $ 116,704 &#160; &#160;Remaining Performance ObligationsAs of March 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was $9.2 million, of which the Company expects to recognize over 80% within the next two years, 17% between two to four years and the remainder thereafter. The timing of revenue recognition within the next four years is largely dependent upon the go-live dates of the Company's customers under the Company&#x2019;s contracts.As of March 31, 2023, the Company has contractual rights under its commercial agreements to receive $53.5 million of fixed consideration related to the future minimum guarantees through 2026. As permitted, the Company has elected to exclude from this disclosure any variable consideration that meets specified criteria. Accordingly, the total unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations related to processing services is significantly higher than the amount disclosed.Contract BalancesContract balances consist of the following: &#160; &#160; March 31, &#160; &#160; December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2023 &#160; &#160; 2022 &#160; &#160; Contract Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Costs to fulfill (prepaid expenses and other current assets) &#160; $ 2,742 &#160; &#160; $ 2,732 &#160; &#160; Costs to fulfill (other long-term assets) &#160; &#160; 6,283 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,929 &#160; &#160; Total contract assets &#160; $ 9,025 &#160; &#160; $ 9,661 &#160; &#160; Contract Liabilities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Contract liabilities &#160; $ 4,639 &#160; &#160; $ 4,358 &#160; &#160; Contract liabilities, less current portion &#160; &#160; 4,606 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,826 &#160; &#160; Total contract liabilities &#160; $ 9,245 &#160; &#160; $ 7,184 &#160; &#160; During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company reduced revenue and the related contract assets by $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively.Revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 that was included in the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of each of the periods was $0.7 million in each period. &#160; 11 &#160; 4. Business CombinationsPROFIT Financial, Inc.On December 19, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of PROFIT Financial, Inc. (&#34;PROFIT&#34;) by acquiring all outstanding shares of PROFIT for a total purchase price of approximately $4.3 million, net of cash acquired, comprised of $3.3 million cash of which $0.1 million is included as a short term payable at December 31, 2022 and $0.6 million is being held back by the Company for a period of twelve to twenty-four months following the transaction close date and is recorded in finance leases and other finance obligations, net of current portion in the consolidated balance sheets.

There were no measurement period adjustments to the purchase price allocation during the three months ended March 31, 2023.The revenue and expenses of PROFIT have been included in the Company's consolidated financial results since the acquisition date. Pro forma results of operations related to the acquisition have not been presented for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 because the effects of this acquisition were not material to the Company's overall operations. 5.

There have been no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations or commitments outside of the ordinary course of business as compared to those described in the 2022 Form 10-K.Legal MattersThe Company is involved from time to time in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company believes that none of its current claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023. IndemnificationThe Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including business partners, investors, contractors, customers, and the Company&#x2019;s officers, directors, and certain employees.

The Company seeks to limit, or cap, its indemnification exposure in its commercial and other contracts. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company&#x2019;s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. 9. Stock-Based CompensationIn May 2021, the Company&#x2019;s board of directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#x201c;2021 Plan&#x201d;), which became effective in connection with the IPO. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, to the Company&#x2019;s employees and any of its parent or subsidiary corporations&#x2019; employees, and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and performance awards to the Company&#x2019;s employees, directors and consultants and any of its parent or subsidiary corporations&#x2019; employees and consultants.

Restricted Stock Units (&#x201c;RSUs&#x201d;)A summary of the Company&#x2019;s RSU activity during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was as follows: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Weighted- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Average &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Number of &#160; &#160; Grant Date &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; RSUs Outstanding &#160; &#160; Fair Value &#160; Awarded and unvested at December 31, 2022 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,362,420 &#160; &#160; $ 18.03 &#160; Awards granted &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 655,959 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8.45 &#160; Awards vested &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (40,491 ) &#160; &#160; 26.62 &#160; Awards forfeited &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (31,585 ) &#160; &#160; 17.03 &#160; Awarded and unvested at March 31, 2023 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,946,303 &#160; &#160; $ 14.64 &#160; The fair value of RSU grants is determined based upon the market closing price of the Company&#x2019;s Class A common stock on the date of grant. RSUs vest over the requisite service period, which generally ranges between four years and five years from the date of grant, subject to continued employment for employees and provision of services for nonemployees. Stock-based compensation expense included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations was as follows (in thousands):&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2023 &#160; &#160; 2022 &#160; &#160; Cost of revenue &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 45 &#160; &#160; $ &#x2014; &#160; &#160; Operating expenses &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Research and development &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 546 &#160; &#160; &#160; 285 &#160; &#160; Sales and marketing &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 716 &#160; &#160; &#160; 223 &#160; &#160; General and administrative &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 852 &#160; &#160; &#160; 768 &#160; &#160; Total stock-based compensation &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 2,159 &#160; &#160; $ 1,276 &#160; &#160; At March 31, 2023, there was $1.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 1.1 years.At March 31, 2023, there was $25.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs granted under the 2021 Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 3.5 years. &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; 10. Income TaxesThe Company computes its tax provision for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 by applying the year-to-date actual effective tax rate from recurring operations as the best estimate of its annual effective tax rate. The Company continues to record a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets (&#34;DTA&#34;) in the US as it is not more likely than not to be realized given near break-even operations and prior year significant tax deductions for stock-based compensation. The Company&#x2019;s effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 is (57.9%) and 226.4%, respectively. In the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded a benefit from a return to provision adjustment in connection with a change in estimate of costs required to be capitalized under IRC Section 174. Excluding the return to provision benefit, the Company's effective tax rate in quarter ended March 31, 2023 was 102%. The difference between the Company&#x2019;s effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily the result of near break-even pre-tax income from operations, state taxes and the impact of the full valuation allowance and other permanent adjustments. In 2022, the difference between the Company&#x2019;s effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily the result of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 11. Net Income per Share Attributable to Common StockBasic earnings per share attributable to common stock is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.Diluted net income per share attributable to common stock is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents to the extent they are dilutive. The dilutive effect of outstanding options, RSUs and warrants is reflected in diluted net income per share attributable to common stock by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income per share attributable to common stock excludes all anti-dilutive common shares. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to each class of common stock and the resulting basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders are, therefore, the same for both Class A and Class B common stock on both an individual and combined basis.The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stock (in thousands except share and per share data): &#160; &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2023 &#160; &#160; 2022 &#160; &#160; Numerator: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net income &#160; $ 704 &#160; &#160; $ 1,718 &#160; &#160; Denominator: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Weighted-average shares of common stock &#x2014; basic &#160; &#160; 123,289,584 &#160; &#160; &#160; 120,897,576 &#160; &#160; Dilutive effect of stock options to purchase common stock &#160; &#160; 486,286 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,976,726 &#160; &#160; Dilutive effect of RSUs &#160; &#160; 16,871 &#160; &#160; &#160; 26,347 &#160; &#160; Dilutive effect of warrants &#160; &#160; &#x2014; &#160; &#160; &#160; 85,861 &#160; &#160; Weighted-average shares of common stock &#x2014; diluted &#160; &#160; 123,792,741 &#160; &#160; &#160; 125,986,510 &#160; &#160; Net income per share &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Basic &#160; $ 0.01 &#160; &#160; $ 0.01 &#160; &#160; Diluted &#160; $ 0.01 &#160; &#160; $ 0.01 &#160; &#160; The following table summarizes the weighted average securities that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share attributable to common stock as their inclusion would have been antidilutive: &#160; &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2023 &#160; &#160; 2022 &#160; &#160; Stock options to purchase common stock &#160; &#160; 3,594,345 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#x2014; &#160; &#160; RSUs &#160; &#160; 1,319,253 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,748 &#160; &#160; Warrants &#160; &#160; 588,173 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#x2014; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 16 &#160; &#160; Item 2. Management&#x2019;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are a leading provider of cloud-based bill payment technology and solutions. We deliver our next-generation product suite through a modern technology stack to more than 1,900 biller business and financial institution clients. Our platform was used by approximately 27 million consumers and businesses in North America in December 2022 to pay their bills, make money movements and engage with our clients. We serve billers of all sizes that primarily provide non-discretionary services across a variety of industry verticals, including utilities, financial services, insurance, government, telecommunications and healthcare. We also serve financial institutions by providing them with a modern platform that their customers use for bill payment, account-to-account transfers and person-to-person transfers. By powering this comprehensive network of billers and financial institutions, each with their own set of bill payment requirements, we believe we have created an enviable feedback loop that enables us to continuously drive innovation, grow our business and uniquely improve the electronic bill payment experience for participants in the bill payment ecosystem. Our platform provides our clients with easy-to-use, flexible and secure electronic bill payment experiences powered by an omni-channel payment infrastructure that allows consumers to pay their bills using their preferred payment type and channel. Because our biller platform is developed on a single code base and leverages a SaaS infrastructure, we can rapidly deploy new features and tools to our entire biller base simultaneously. Through a single point of integration to our billers&#x2019; core financial and operating systems, our mission-critical solutions provide our billers with a payments operating system that helps them collect revenue faster and more profitably and empower their consumers with the information and transparency needed to control their finances. We generate substantially all of our revenue from payment transaction fees and have achieved significant growth through our capital efficient model. We rely on a diversified go-to-market strategy to reach new billers. We acquire new billers through direct sales channels, software and strategic partnerships and our Instant Payment Network, or IPN, which together promote rapid adoption of our platform through partnerships with leading business networks. Through these channels, our platform reaches millions of consumers, driving transaction growth. We believe our revenue is highly visible. We derive the majority of our revenue from a fee paid per transaction by the consumer, the biller or a combination of both. Our usage-based monetization strategy aligns our economic success with the success of our billers and partners. Since we benefit from increased transactional volume, we do not charge separate license fees or implementation fees. In addition, our modern platform architecture generally allows us to provide integration, implementation, maintenance and system upgrades at no additional cost to billers. Initiatives to Drive Results of Operations Acquiring New and Maintaining Existing Billers and Financial Institutions Our future growth depends on the continued adoption of our platform by new billers and financial institutions, as well as maintaining our existing billers and financial institutions. We intend to continue investing in our efficient go-to-market strategies, increasing brand awareness and driving adoption of our platform and products. We had more than 1,900 billers and financial institution clients as of December 31, 2022, including billers of all sizes and across numerous vertical markets and financial institutions of all sizes. Our ability to attract new, and maintain existing, billers and financial institutions and drive adoption of our platform will depend on a number of factors, including the effectiveness and pricing of our products, offerings of our competitors and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Our growth and performance also depends on our ability to promptly implement and begin recognizing revenues from our new billers and financial institutions. Expanding Usage of Our Platform with Existing Billers and Financial Institutions We believe our large base of existing billers and financial institutions represents a significant opportunity for further consumption of our platform. We believe our solutions create a superior experience for consumers and accelerate revenue realization for billers, which drives increased usage of our platform. We intend to continue investing in this value proposition. Leveraging our platform to capture more transactions from our existing biller and financial institution base is expected to organically drive transaction growth at lower cost. Growing Our Partner Base We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase the transactions on our platform through expanding our base of software, strategic and IPN partners. While revenue derived from or through our IPN partnerships has not been significant historically, we expect that the revenue contribution from our IPN will grow over time. As our IPN partner base expands, and new partners use our platform to power bill payment experiences within their ecosystems, we expect to organically expand the reach of our platform to millions of new consumers and thereby drive new, revenue-generating transactions to our platform. We intend to invest in the expansion of our partner base, including the addition of new IPN partners, because our ability to secure new partners will have a direct impact on our transaction growth. &#160; 17 &#160; Investing in Sales and Marketing We will continue to expand efforts to market our platform through our diversified sales and marketing strategy. We intend to invest in sales and marketing strategies that we believe will drive further brand awareness and preference among our billers, financial institutions, partners and consumers. Given the nature of our biller, financial institution and partner base, our investment in sales and marketing in a given period may not impact results until subsequent periods. We approach sales and marketing spend strategically to maintain efficient biller and partner acquisition. Innovation and Enhancement of Our Platform We will continue to invest in our platform and IPN to maintain our position as a leading provider of biller communication and payments. To drive adoption and increase penetration of our platform, we intend to continue to introduce new products and features. We believe that investment in research and development will contribute to our long-term growth, but may also negatively impact our short-term profitability. We will continue to leverage emerging technologies and invest in the development of more features and better functionality for consumers. Increased Adoption of Electronic Bill Payment Solutions As the number of financial transactions online continues to increase, electronic bill payment is becoming a greater share of the bill payment market. We have observed that consumers demand a frictionless electronic bill payment experience and increasingly prefer more flexible and innovative digital payment options. We expect this trend to continue, providing us with a greater opportunity to provide next-generation bill and digital payment technology and power more transactions, further fueling our growth. Transactions Processed &#160; &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2023 &#160; &#160; 2022 &#160; &#160; % Growth &#160; &#160; &#160; (in millions) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Transactions processed &#160; 108.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 87.9 &#160; &#160; &#160; 23.4 % &#160; We define transactions processed as the number of revenue generating payment transactions, such as checks, credit card and debit card transactions, automated clearing house, or ACH, items and emerging payment types, which are initiated and generally processed through our platform during a period. The number of transactions also includes account-to-account and person-to-person transfers. The number of transactions processed during the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased approximately 23.4% as compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of new billers and financial institutions and increased transactions from our existing billers and financial institutions. &#160; Other Key Factors and Trends Affecting Our Operating Results The discussion below includes a number of forward-looking statements regarding our future performance. For a discussion of important factors, including the continuing development of our business and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from matters referred to below, see the discussions under &#x201c;Risk Factors&#x201d; and &#x201c;Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&#x201d; herein and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 or the &#x201c;2022 Form 10-K&#x201d;. Impact of Economic and Inflationary Trends In 2022 and continuing into 2023, the United States economy has experienced inflationary conditions, increased interest rates and consecutive quarters of decreased gross domestic product. While we believe our business is resilient and can generally weather unusual levels of inflation, the economic uncertainty and continuing inflationary pressures, which has been particularly acute in the utility sector, impacted our fiscal 2022 and first quarter 2023 financial performance and is expected to impact our 2023 financial performance. For example, some of our clients have deferred anticipated 2022 implementations into 2023 or are reevaluating the development of technology resources, which will delay expected revenue recognition. Furthermore, inflationary pressure is resulting in higher average bills, particularly in the utility sector, and increased interchange fees. While we are seeking to adjust our prices to address the inflationary pressures, our ability to do so typically lags behind the impact of inflation on our clients, the increase in average bill amounts and increased interchange fees. We intend to continue to manage through this uncertain economic environment by working closely with clients on implementations and price adjustments. In addition, although we are focused on prudent expense management, we are seeing ongoing wage pressure in our current workforce due to the levels of inflation, which is also putting some short-term pressure on our EBITDA margins. &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; Non-GAAP Measures We use supplemental measures of our performance that are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These supplemental non-GAAP measures include contribution profit, adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Contribution Profit We calculate contribution profit as gross profit plus other cost of revenue. Other cost of revenue equals cost of revenue less interchange and assessment fees paid by us to our payment processors. Adjusted Gross Profit We calculate adjusted gross profit as gross profit adjusted for non-cash items, primarily stock-based compensation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income before other income (expense) (which consists of interest income (expense), net and foreign exchange gain (loss)), depreciation and amortization, income taxes, adjusted to exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense and certain nonrecurring expenses that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations. Free Cash Flow We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and software and capitalized internal-use software development costs. How we use Non-GAAP Measures We use non-GAAP measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management and our board of directors to more fully understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and helps management project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide our investors with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. In particular, we exclude interchange and assessment fees in the presentation of contribution profit because we believe inclusion is less directly reflective of our operating performance as we do not control the payment channel used by consumers, which is the primary determinant of the amount of interchange and assessment fees. We use contribution profit to measure the amount available to fund our operations after interchange and assessment fees, which are directly linked to the number of transactions we process and thus our revenue and gross profit. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP measures presented in this report. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies; other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We also urge you to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures included below. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. Contribution Profit &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; &#160; March 31, 2023 &#160; &#160; March 31, 2022 &#160; &#160; (in thousands) &#160; &#160;Gross Profit $ 40,078 &#160; &#160; $ 34,854 &#160; Plus: other cost of revenue &#160; 13,453 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,531 &#160; Contribution Profit $ 53,531 &#160; &#160; $ 47,385 &#160; &#160; In general, contribution profit is driven by the number of transactions we process offset by network fees associated with processing those transactions. The amount of contribution profit per transaction may vary due to a variety of factors including client size, type and industry as well as whether the client is a biller, financial institution or other partner. Contribution profit for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased approximately 13.0% as compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by adjusted pricing for certain existing customers related to our inflation management, and growth in transaction count and volume driven by the addition of new billers and financial institutions and increased transactions from our existing billers and financial institutions. 19 &#160; Adjusted Gross Profit &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; &#160; March 31, 2023 &#160; &#160; March 31, 2022 &#160; &#160; (in thousands) &#160; Gross profit $ 40,078 &#160; &#160; $ 34,854 &#160; Stock-based compensation &#160; 45 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#x2014; &#160; Amortization &#160; 3,567 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,510 &#160; Adjusted gross profit $ 43,690 &#160; &#160; $ 37,364 &#160; Adjusted gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased 16.9% as compared to the same period in 2022. Adjusted gross profit is driven primarily by the same factors that impact gross profit with the exception of excluding the amortization in cost of revenue. The increase in amortization was driven by additional capitalization of software costs.

Gross margin decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 due to increases in cost of revenues for other direct costs associated with making our platform available to our billers. Research and Development Expenses The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, including benefits due to an increase in headcount as we continued to invest in building and adding additional features and functionality to our platform. Additionally, we incurred increased stock-based compensation expense associated with routine and new hire grants. Sales and Marketing Expenses The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, including benefits, as we continued to expand our sales and marketing efforts with additional headcount in order to continue to drive our growth. In addition, we incurred higher agency commissions and increased stock-based compensation associated with routine and new hire grants. General and Administrative Expenses The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower costs for our directors and officers insurance and corporate premiums, a reduction in lease costs and reversals of certain bad debts. Other Income (Expense) The changes in other income (expense) was primarily due to the increase in interest income, net as a result of increases in the federal reserve rates which increased interest income on our government issued securities, which are included in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Income Taxes The change in provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to the near break-even pre-tax income from operations, state taxes and the impact of the full valuation allowance and other permanent adjustments in addition to a return to provision benefit recorded in connection with a change in estimate of costs required to be capitalized under IRC Section 174, as compared to prior year discrete excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation recognized in the quarter. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Funds As of March 31, 2023, we had $143.6 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. We believe that existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Since inception, we have financed operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and revenue from payment transaction fees and subscriptions. Our principal uses of cash are funding operations and capital expenditures. From time to time, we may explore additional financing sources and means to lower our cost of capital, which could include equity, equity-linked and debt financing. We cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we may be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business or execute our growth strategy. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. &#160; 22 &#160; Historical Cash Flows The following table summarizes our condensed consolidated cash flows. &#160; &#160; Three Months Ended March 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2023 &#160; &#160; 2022 &#160; &#160; &#160; (in thousands) &#160; &#160;Net cash provided by (used in) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating activities &#160; $ 4,763 &#160; &#160; $ 3,248 &#160; Investing activities &#160; &#160; (8,286 ) &#160; &#160; (7,284 ) Financing activities &#160; &#160; (1,122 ) &#160; &#160; 2,363 &#160; &#160;Effects of foreign exchange on cash &#160; &#160; (17 ) &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160;Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash &#160; $ (4,662 ) &#160; $ (1,663 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Our primary source of operating cash is revenue from payment transaction fees. Our primary uses of operating cash are personnel-related costs, payments to third parties to fulfill our payment transactions and payments to sales and marketing partners. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $4.8 million. Net income was $0.7 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $10.4 million consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of contract assets and non-cash lease expense, which contributed positively to operating activities. This was offset by net cash outflows of $6.4 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $3.2 million. Net income was $1.7 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $9.6 million consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and non-cash lease expense, which contributed positively to operating activities. This was offset by net cash outflows of $8.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 consisted of $8.2 million of capitalized internal-use software development costs and $0.1 million of purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 consisted of $6.7 million of capitalized internal-use software development costs and $0.6 million for purchases of property and equipment and other intangible assets acquired. Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 consisted of $1.0 million of payments on other financing obligations and $0.1 million of payments on finance leases. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 consisted of an increase in financial institution funds in-transit of $3.3 million offset by $1.0 million of payments on finance leases and other financing obligations. &#160; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, &#x201c;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#x201d; to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2022. &#160; Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 &#34;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#34; in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 23 &#160; Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. There have been no material changes in our exposures to market risk since December 31, 2022. For details on the Company&#x2019;s interest rate, foreign currency exchange, and inflation risks, see Part I, Item 7A. &#x201c;Quantitative and Qualitative Information About Market Risk&#x201d; in our 2022 Form 10-K. &#160; Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, and as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level. In light of this fact, our management has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly state, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of March 31, 2023, our material weaknesses were as follows: &#x2022;We lacked a sufficient number of trained professionals with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters, including accounting for capitalized internal-use software development costs, identification of reporting units, translation of foreign currency in consolidation, accounting for deferred compensation, calculation of earnings per share and classification of accounts in the financial statements. Additionally, we did not design and maintain effective controls over verifying the appropriate review and approval of journal entries. &#x2022;We did not design and maintain effective controls relevant to the preparation of our financial statements with respect to certain information technology, or IT, general controls for information systems. Specifically, we did not design and maintain (1) program change management controls to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting certain IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; and (2) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs and data to appropriate company personnel. &#160; 24 &#160; Remediation Plan We believe we have made significant progress toward remediation of the material weaknesses described above. We have completed the following remediation measures: &#x2022;updated the design of our general ledger accounting system to allow for effective restricted access and segregation of duties to govern the preparation and review of journal entries; &#x2022;implemented management review controls over journal entries and the identification and review of complex transactions; &#x2022;secured the general ledger accounting system by implementing Single Sign-On (SSO); and &#x2022;implemented additional change management and access controls for our relevant IT applications to further restrict privileged access. Additional remediation measures are ongoing and include the following: &#x2022;implementing controls to review activities, which may materially affect our financial statements, for those users who have privileged access; and &#x2022;continuing to hire additional personnel with public company experience for our accounting and finance function. While we believe these efforts will remediate the material weaknesses, these material weaknesses cannot be considered fully remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended March 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. &#160; 25 &#160; PART II&#x2014;OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be involved in claims, regulatory examinations or investigations and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. The outcome of any such claims or proceedings, regardless of the merits, and the Company&#x2019;s ultimate liability, if any, is inherently uncertain. Furthermore, we may become subject to stockholder inspection demands under Delaware law and derivative or other similar litigation. We are not currently party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A. of our 2022 Form 10-K. &#160; Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Recently, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (&#x201c;SVB&#x201d;) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#x201c;FDIC&#x201d;) as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each placed into receivership. Although we assess our banking and customer relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect us, the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others, actual or perceived events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry, companies that do business with such companies or companies that have customers or partners that do business with such companies. In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not described above, could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity and our business, financial condition or results of operations. &#160; Item 2.
