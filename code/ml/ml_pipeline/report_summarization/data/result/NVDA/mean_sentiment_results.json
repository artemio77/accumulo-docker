        "297": "qualification time for new products , customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue .",
        "298": "we have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions , and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions .",

        "301": "we sell most of our products through channel partners , who sell to distributors , retailers , and / or end customers .",
        "302": "as a result , the decisions made by our channel partners , distributors , retailers , and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand , particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties . if we underestimate our customers ' future demand for our products , our foundry partners may not have adequate lead - time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis .",
        "303": "even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand , we may not be able to do so in a cost - effective or timely manner , or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints .",
        "304": "if we fail to fulfill our customers & # 8217 ; orders on a timely basis , or at all , our customer relationships could be damaged , we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed . if we overestimate our customers & # 8217 ; future demand for our products , or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors , we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments .",
        "305": "in the past , we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices , including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement , as a result of our overestimation of future demand , and we may need to continue these reductions .",
        "306": "we have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers & # 8217 ; increase in prices , and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future .",
        "307": "we have also written - down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties , and recorded impairments .",
        "308": "these impacts were amplified by our placement of non - cancellable and non - returnable purchasing terms , well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products .",
        "309": "the risk of these impacts has increased as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and become a greater portion of our total supply while our 19table of contentsrevenue has sequentially declined .",
        "310": "all of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results . we build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist .",
        "311": "examples include our omniverse platform and third - party large language models and generative models .",
        "312": "our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels , and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and applications . challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis .",
        "313": "extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters , pandemics or other events , such as the covid - 19 pandemic .",
        "314": "in addition , geopolitical tensions , such as those involving taiwan and china , which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers , contract manufacturers , and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us . the use of our gpus for other than that for which they were designed and marketed , including new and unexpected use cases , has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products , including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand .",
        "315": "for example , a number of years ago , our gaming gpus began to be used for digital currency mining , including blockchain - based platforms such as ethereum .",
        "316": "it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision , the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining , or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining , on demand for our products .",
        "317": "volatility in the cryptocurrency market , including new compute technologies , price changes in cryptocurrencies , government cryptocurrency policies and regulations , new cryptocurrency standards , and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions , has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products .",
        "318": "changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including , but not limited to , the recently implemented ethereum 2 . 0 merge may decrease the usage of gpus for ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales of our gpus , which could negatively impact retail prices for our gpus and reduce demand for our new gpus .",
        "319": "we previously introduced lite hash rate , or lhr , geforce gpus with limited ethereum mining capability and provided cmp products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to cmp .",

        "321": "in addition , our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized & # 8220 ; gray market , & # 8221 ; which also makes demand forecasting difficult .",
        "322": "gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels . additionally , we depend on developers and other third parties to build accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms .",
        "323": "we also rely on third - party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as geforce now .",
        "324": "failure by developers to build applications that leverage our platforms , or failure by third - party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms , could adversely affect customer demand . dependency on third - party suppliers and their technology to manufacture , assemble , test , package or design our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality , manufacturing yields , development , enhancement and product delivery schedules and could harm our business . we depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques .",
        "325": "we do not assemble , test or package our products , but instead contract with independent subcontractors .",
