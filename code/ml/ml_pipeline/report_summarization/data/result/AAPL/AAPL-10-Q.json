Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation and PreparationThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively &#8220;Apple&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company&#8217;s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period&#8217;s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September&#160;24, 2022.The Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023.

However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.Foreign Exchange RiskTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of April&#160;1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt&#8211;related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 8The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.Interest Rate RiskTo protect the Company&#8217;s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.The notional amounts of the Company&#8217;s outstanding derivative instruments as of April&#160;1, 2023 and September&#160;24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):April 1,2023September 24,2022Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:Foreign exchange contracts$51,119&#160;$102,670&#160;Interest rate contracts$19,375&#160;$20,125&#160;Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:Foreign exchange contracts$111,696&#160;$185,381&#160;The gross fair values of the Company&#8217;s derivative assets and liabilities as of September&#160;24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):September 24, 2022Fair Value ofDerivatives Designatedas Accounting HedgesFair Value ofDerivatives Not Designatedas Accounting HedgesTotalFair ValueDerivative assets (1):Foreign exchange contracts$4,317&#160;$2,819&#160;$7,136&#160;Derivative liabilities (2):Foreign exchange contracts$2,205&#160;$2,547&#160;$4,752&#160;Interest rate contracts$1,367&#160;$&#8212;&#160;$1,367&#160;(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.The derivative assets above represent the Company&#8217;s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company&#8217;s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September&#160;24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company&#8217;s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.The carrying amounts of the Company&#8217;s hedged items in fair value hedges as of April&#160;1, 2023 and September&#160;24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):April 1,2023September 24,2022Hedged assets/(liabilities):Current and non-current marketable securities$14,651&#160;$13,378&#160;Current and non-current term debt$(18,249)$(18,739)Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 9Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As of both April&#160;1, 2023 and September&#160;24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company&#8217;s cellular network carriers accounted for 32% and 44% of total trade receivables as of April&#160;1, 2023 and September&#160;24, 2022, respectively.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of April&#160;1, 2023, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43%, 19% and 13%. As of September&#160;24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.Note 4 &#8211; Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement DetailsThe following tables show the Company&#8217;s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of April&#160;1, 2023 and September&#160;24, 2022 (in millions):InventoriesApril 1,2023September 24,2022Components$3,379&#160;$1,637&#160;Finished goods4,103&#160;3,309&#160;Total inventories$7,482&#160;$4,946&#160;Property, Plant and Equipment, NetApril 1,2023September 24,2022Gross property, plant and equipment$113,066&#160;$114,457&#160;Accumulated depreciation and amortization(69,668)(72,340)Total property, plant and equipment, net$43,398&#160;$42,117&#160;Other Income/(Expense), NetThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March&#160;26, 2022 (in millions):Three Months EndedSix Months EndedApril 1,2023March 26,2022April 1,2023March 26,2022Interest and dividend income$918&#160;$700&#160;$1,786&#160;$1,350&#160;Interest expense(930)(691)(1,933)(1,385)Other income/(expense), net76&#160;151&#160;(182)(52)Total other income/(expense), net$64&#160;$160&#160;$(329)$(87)Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 10Note 5 &#8211; Income TaxesEuropean Commission State Aid DecisionOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the &#8220;State Aid Decision&#8221;). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the &#8220;General Court&#8221;). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court&#8217;s decision to the European Court of Justice and a hearing has been scheduled for May 23, 2023. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.Note 6 &#8211; DebtCommercial PaperThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (&#8220;Commercial Paper&#8221;) pursuant to a commercial paper program.

Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as &#8220;future,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company&#8217;s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September&#160;24, 2022 (the &#8220;2022 Form 10-K&#8221;) under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company&#8217;s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company&#8217;s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the &#8220;Company&#8221; and &#8220;Apple&#8221; as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.Available InformationThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company&#8217;s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company&#8217;s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.Fiscal PeriodThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.Quarterly HighlightsWeakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company&#8217;s total net sales, which decreased 3% or $2.4 billion during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022.

(&#8220;Epic&#8221;) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the &#8220;Northern California District Court&#8221;) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California&#8217;s unfair competition law based upon the Company&#8217;s operation of its App Store&#174;. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic&#8217;s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company&#8217;s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company&#8217;s App Store Review Guidelines violate California&#8217;s unfair competition law and issued an injunction.

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.Item 1A.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Risk FactorsThe Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.
